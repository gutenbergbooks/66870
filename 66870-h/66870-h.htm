<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In an Appendix to his “Buddhism in Tibet,” Dr. Emil Schlagintweit has given “An alphabetical
list of the books and memoirs connected with Buddhism.” Although not completely exhaustive,
it occupies thirty-five pages, and contains references to more than a hundred separate
works, and a much larger number of essays and other literary articles. Of those books
and articles, the titles of about sixty allude to Tibet. To them may be referred readers
who wish for detailed information about that country, its literature, and its religion.
All that it is proposed to do here is to say a few words about the Tibetan work from
which have been extracted the tales contained in the present volume; to give a short
account of the enthusiastic Hungarian scholar, Csoma Körösi, who had so much to do
with making that work known to Europe; and to call attention to any features which
the stories now before us may have in common with European folk-tales. To do more,
without merely repeating what has been already said, would require a rare amount of
special knowledge; and it may safely be asserted that remarks about Buddhism, made
by writers who do not possess such knowledge, are seldom of signal value.
</p>
<p>The tales contained in the sacred books of Tibet, it may be as well to remark at the
outset, appear to have little that is specially Tibetan about them except their language.
Stories possessing characteristic features and suffused with local colour may possibly
live in the memories of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">viii</a>]</span>natives of that region of lofty and bleak table-lands, with which so few Europeans
have had an opportunity of becoming familiar. But the legends and fables which the
late Professor Schiefner has translated from the Kah-gyur are merely Tibetan versions
of Sanskrit writings. No mention is made in them of those peculiarities of Tibetan
Buddhism which have most struck the fancy of foreign observers. They never allude
to the rosary of 108 beads which every Tibetan carries, “that he may keep a reckoning
of his good words, which supply to him the place of good deeds;” the praying wheels,
“those curious machines which, filled with prayers, or charms, or passages from holy
books, stand in the towns in every open place, are placed beside the footpaths and
the roads, revolve in every stream, and even (by the help of sails like those of windmills)
are turned by every breeze which blows o’er the thrice-sacred valleys of Tibet;” the
“Trees of the Law,” the lofty flagstaffs from which flutter banners emblazoned with
the sacred words, “Ah! the jewel is in the lotus,” the turning of which towards heaven
by the wind counts as the utterance of a prayer capable of bringing down blessings
upon the whole country-side; or of that Lamaism which “bears outwardly, at least,
a strong resemblance to Romanism, in spite of the essential difference of its teachings
and of its mode of thought.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e702src" href="#xd31e702">1</a> There is, therefore, no present need to dwell at length upon the land into which
the legends and doctrines were transplanted which had previously flourished on Indian
soil, or the people by whom they have been religiously preserved, but whose actions
and thoughts they do not by any means fully represent. “At the present day,” says
Mr. Rhys Davids, “the Buddhism of Nepāl and Tibet differs from the Buddhism of Ceylon
as much as the Christianity of Rome or of Moscow differs from that of Scotland or
Wales. But,” he proceeds to say, “the history of Buddhism <span class="pageNum" id="pb.ix">[<a href="#pb.ix">ix</a>]</span>from its commencement to its close is an epitome of the religious history of mankind.
And we have not solved the problem of Buddhism when we have understood the faith of
the early Buddhists. It is in this respect that the study of later Buddhism in Ceylon,
Burma, and Siam, in Nepāl and in Tibet, in China, Mongolia, and Japan, is only second
in importance to the study of early Buddhism.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e707src" href="#xd31e707">2</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>With regard to the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet, Emil Schlagintweit<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e714src" href="#xd31e714">3</a> remarks that “the early history is involved in darkness and myth.” Sanang Setsen,
in his “History of the East Mongols,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e720src" href="#xd31e720">4</a> says that during the reign of King Hlatotori, who came to the throne in 367 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, four objects descended from heaven one day and lighted upon the golden terrace of
his palace, “namely, the image of two hands in the position of prayer, a golden pyramid-temple
an ell high, a small coffer with a gem marked with the six fundamental syllables (Om-ma-ni-pad-mè-hûm),
and the manual called <i>Szamadok</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e731src" href="#xd31e731">5</a> As the king did not understand the nature of the holy objects, he ordered them to
be locked up in his treasury. While they lay there, “misfortune came upon the king.
If children were born, they came into the world blind; fruits and grain came to nothing;
cattle plague, famine, and pestilence prevailed; and of unavoidable misery was there
much.” But after forty years had passed, there came five strangers to the king and
said, “Great king, how couldst thou let these objects, so mystic and powerful, be
cast into the treasury?” Having thus spoken, they <span class="pageNum" id="pb.x">[<a href="#pb.x">x</a>]</span>suddenly disappeared. Therefore the king ordered the holy objects to be brought forth
from the treasury, and to be attached to the points of standards, and treated with
the utmost respect and reverence. After that all went well: the king became prosperous
and long-lived, children were born beautiful, famine and pestilence came to an end,
and in their place appeared happiness and welfare. With the date of this event Sanang
Setsen connects the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet; but according to Tibetan
historians, says Schlagintweit, “the earliest period of the propagation of Buddhism,
which reached down till the end of the tenth century <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, begins with King Srongtsan Gampo, who was born in the year 617 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, and died 698.” This king is said to have sent a mission to India in the year 632
<span class="asc">A.D.</span>, the result of which was the invention of a Tibetan alphabet, based upon Devanāgari
characters, and the translation into Tibetan of Indian sacred books. In his introduction
of Buddhism into his kingdom he is said to have been “most energetically supported
by his two wives, one of whom was a Nepalese, the other a Chinese princess. Both of
them, who throughout their lifetime proved most faithful votaries to the faith of
Buddha, are worshipped either under the general name of Dolma (in Sanskrit Tārā),
or under the respective names of Dolkar and Doljang.” After making considerable progress
during the reign of this monarch, the new religion lost ground under his immediate
successors. “But under one of them, Thisrong de tsan, … Buddhism began to revive,
owing to the useful regulations proclaimed by this king. He it was who successfully
crushed an attempt made by the chiefs during his minority to suppress the new creed,
and it is principally due to him that the Buddhist faith became henceforth permanently
established.”
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the ninth century, continues Schlagintweit, Buddhism was strongly
opposed by a ruler who “commanded all temples and monasteries to be demolished, the
images to be destroyed, and the sacred books to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xi">[<a href="#pb.xi">xi</a>]</span>burnt;” and his son and successor is also said to have died “without religion;” but
his grandson was favourably inclined towards Buddhism, and rebuilt eight temples.
“With this period we have to connect ‘the second propagation of Buddhism;’ it received,
especially from the year 971 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, a powerful impetus from the joint endeavours of the returned Tibetan priests (who
had fled the country under the preceding kings), and of the learned Indian priest
Pandita Atisha and his pupil Brom-ston. Shortly before Atisha came to Tibet, 1041
<span class="asc">A.D.</span>, the Kāla Chakra doctrine, or Tantrika mysticism, was introduced into Tibet, and
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries many Indian refugees settled in the country,
who greatly assisted the Tibetans in the translation of Sanskrit books.” It is probably
from this period that the Kah-gyur dates.
</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century arose the reformer Tsonkhapa, who “imposed upon himself
the difficult task of uniting and reconciling the dialectical and mystical schools
which Tibetan Buddhism had brought forth, and also of eradicating the abuses gradually
introduced by the priests.” Tradition asserts that he “had some intercourse with a
stranger from the West, who was remarkable for a long nose. Huc believes this stranger
to have been a European missionary, and connects the resemblance of the religious
service in Tibet to the Roman Catholic ritual with the information which Tsonkhapa
might have received from this Roman Catholic priest. We are not yet able to decide
the question as to how far Buddhism may have borrowed from Christianity; but the rites
of the Buddhists enumerated by the French missionary can for the most part either
be traced back to institutions peculiar to Buddhism, or they have sprung up in periods
posterior to Tsonkhapa.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e758src" href="#xd31e758">6</a>
</p>
<p>Mr. Rhys Davids has remarked that, “As in India, after the expulsion of Buddhism,
the degrading worship of <span class="corr" id="xd31e763" title="Source: Siva">Śiva</span> and his dusky bride had been incorporated into <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xii">[<a href="#pb.xii">xii</a>]</span>Brahmanism from the wild and savage devil-worship of the dark non-Aryan tribes, so
as pure Buddhism died away in the North, the <i>Tantra system</i>, a mixture of magic and witchcraft and <span class="corr" id="xd31e770" title="Source: Siva-worship">Śiva-worship</span>, was incorporated into the corrupted Buddhism.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e773src" href="#xd31e773">7</a> Of this change for the worse, evidence about which there can be no mistake is supplied
by the Tibetan sacred books. Dr. Malan, who has made himself acquainted with the contents
of some of their volumes in the original, says,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e777src" href="#xd31e777">8</a> “There are passages of great beauty and great good sense, the most abstruse metaphysics,
and the most absurd and incredible stories; yet not worse than those told in the Talmud,
which equal or even surpass them in absurdity.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>On New Year’s day 1820, a traveller started from Bucharest on an adventurous journey
towards the East. His name was Alexander Csoma Körösi (or de Körös),<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e784src" href="#xd31e784">9</a> and he was one of the sons of a Szekler military family of Eger-patak, in the Transylvanian
circle of Hungary. In 1799, when he seems to have been about nine years old,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e787src" href="#xd31e787">10</a> he was sent to the Protestant College at Nagy-Enyed, where he studied for many years
with the idea of taking orders. In 1815 he was sent to Germany, and there he studied
for three years, chiefly at the University of Göttingen, where he attended the lectures
of the celebrated Orientalist Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. After his return from Germany,
he spent the greater part of the year 1819 in studying various Slavonic dialects,
first at Temesvar in Lower Hungary, then at Agram in Croatia. But he soon resolved
to apply himself to less-known tongues.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiii">[<a href="#pb.xiii">xiii</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Among other liberal pursuits,” he wrote in 1825,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e793src" href="#xd31e793">11</a> “my favourite studies were philology, geography, and history. Although my <span class="corr" id="xd31e796" title="Source: eclesiastical">ecclesiastical</span> studies had prepared me for an honourable employment in my native country, yet my
inclination for the studies above-mentioned induced me to seek a wider field for their
future cultivation. As my parents were dead, and my only brother did not want my assistance,
I resolved to leave my native country and to come towards the East, and, by some means
or other procuring subsistence, to devote my whole life to researches which may be
afterwards useful in general to the learned world of Europe, and in particular may
illustrate some obscure facts in ancient history.” Having no hope, he says, of obtaining
“an imperial passport” for his journey, he procured “a printed Hungarian passport
at Nagy-Enyed, to come on some pretended business to Bucharest,” intending to study
Turkish there and then to go on to Constantinople. But he could obtain neither instruction
in Turkish nor the means of going direct to Constantinople. So he set forth from Bucharest
on the 1st of January 1820, and travelled with some Bulgarian companions to Philippopolis.
Tidings of plague forced him to turn aside to the coast of the Archipelago, whence
he sailed in a Greek ship to Alexandria. Driven from that city by the plague, he made
his way by sea to the coast of Syria, and thence on foot to Aleppo. From that city
he proceeded to Bagdad, which he reached in July, travelling part of the way on foot,
“with different caravans from various places, in an Asiatic dress,” and the rest “by
water on a raft.” In September he left Bagdad, travelling in European costume on horseback
with a caravan, and in the middle of next month he arrived at Teheran. In the capital
of Persia he spent four months. In March 1821 he again started with a caravan, travelling
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiv">[<a href="#pb.xiv">xiv</a>]</span>as an Armenian, and, after a stay of six months in Khorasán, arrived in the middle
of November at Bokhara. There he intended to pass the winter; but at the end of five
days, “affrighted by frequent exaggerated reports of the approach of a numerous Russian
army,” he travelled with a caravan to Kabul, where he arrived early in January 1822.
At the end of a fortnight he again set out with a caravan. Making acquaintance on
the way with Runjeet Sing’s French officers, Generals Allard and Ventura, he accompanied
them to Lahore. By their aid he obtained permission to enter Kashmir, with the intention
of proceeding to Yarkand; but finding that the road was “very difficult, expensive,
and dangerous for a Christian,” he set out from Leh in Ladak, the farthest point he
reached, to return to Lahore. On his way back, near the Kashmir frontier, he met Mr.
Moorcroft and returned with him to Leh. There Mr. Moorcroft lent him the “<span lang="la">Alphabetum Tibetanum</span>,” the ponderous work published at Rome in 1762, compiled by Father Antonio Agostino
Giorgi out of the materials sent from Tibet by the Capuchin Friars. Its perusal induced
him to stay for some time at Leh in order to study Tibetan, profiting by “the conversation
and instruction of an intelligent person, who was well acquainted with the Tibetan
and Persian languages.” During the winter, which he spent at Kashmir, he became so
interested in Tibetan that he determined to devote himself to its study, so as to
be able to “penetrate into those numerous and highly interesting volumes which are
to be found in every large monastery.” He communicated his ideas to Mr. Moorcroft,
who fully approved of his plan, and provided him with money and official recommendations.
Starting afresh from Kashmir in May 1823, he reached Leh in the beginning of June.
From that city, he says, “travelling in a south-westerly direction, I arrived on the
ninth day at <i>Yangla</i>, and from the 20th of June 1823 to the 22d of October 1824 I sojourned in Zanskár
(the most south-western province of Ladákh), <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xv">[<a href="#pb.xv">xv</a>]</span>where I applied myself to the Tibetan literature, assisted by the Lámá.”
</p>
<p>With the approach of winter he left <span class="corr" id="xd31e811" title="Source: Zanskar">Zanskár</span>, and towards the end of November 1824 arrived at Sabathú. In the letter which he
wrote during his stay there, in January 1825, he says, “At my first entrance to the
British Indian territory, I was fully persuaded I should be received as a friend by
the Government.” Nor was he disappointed. As at Bagdad and Teheran, so in India was
the Hungarian pilgrim welcomed and assisted by the British authorities. In 1826 he
seems (says Dr. Archibald Campbell<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e814src" href="#xd31e814">12</a>) to have paid a second visit to Western Tibet, and to have continued “to study in
the monasteries of that country, living in the poorest possible manner,” till 1831.
In the autumn of that year Dr. Campbell met him at Simla, “dressed in a coarse blue
cloth loose gown, extending to his heels, and a small cloth cap of the same material.
He wore a grizzly beard, shunned the society of Europeans, and passed his whole time
in study.” It is much to be regretted that he has left no record of his residence
in the monasteries in which he passed so long a time, in one of which, “with the thermometer
below zero for more than four months, he was precluded by the severity of the weather
from stirring out of a room nine feet square. Yet in this situation he read from morning
till evening without a fire, the ground forming his bed, and the walls of the building
his protection against the rigours of the climate, and still he collected and arranged
forty thousand words in the language of Tibet, and nearly completed his Dictionary
and Grammar.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e817src" href="#xd31e817">13</a> Day after day, says M. Pavie,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e820src" href="#xd31e820">14</a> he would sit in a wretched hut at the door of a monastery, reading <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvi">[<a href="#pb.xvi">xvi</a>]</span>aloud Buddhistic works with a Lama by his side. When a page was finished, the two
readers would nudge each other’s elbows. The question was which of them was to turn
over the leaf, thereby exposing his hand for the moment, unprotected by the long-furred
sleeve, to the risk of being frost-bitten.
</p>
<p>In May 1832 he went to Calcutta, where he met with great kindness from many scholars,
especially Professor H.&nbsp;H. Wilson and Mr. James Prinsep, and, after a time, he was
appointed assistant-librarian to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. At Calcutta he spent
many years, and there his two principal works, the “Essay Towards a Dictionary, Tibetan
and English,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e834src" href="#xd31e834">15</a> and the “Grammar of the Tibetan Language,” were brought out at the expense of Government
in 1834. “In the beginning of 1836,” says Dr. Campbell, “his anxiety to visit Lassa
induced him to leave Calcutta for Titalya, in the hope of accomplishing his design
through Bootan, Sikim, or Nipal.” Of his life in Titalya, where he seems to have spent
more than a year, some account is given by Colonel G.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;A. Lloyd, who says, “He would
not remain in my house, as he thought his eating and living with me would cause him
to be deprived of the familiarity and society of the natives, with whom it was his
wish to be colloquially intimate, and I therefore got him a common native hut, and
made it as comfortable as I could for him, but still he seemed to me to be miserably
off. I also got him a servant, to whom he paid three or four rupees a month, and his
living did not cost him more than four more.”
</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1837<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e840src" href="#xd31e840">16</a> he returned to Calcutta. I have been favoured by a very accomplished linguist, the
Rev. S.&nbsp;C. Malan, D.D., Rector of Broadwindsor, Dorset, <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvii">[<a href="#pb.xvii">xvii</a>]</span>who was at one time secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, with an account of
his acquaintance with Csoma Körösi during the Hungarian scholar’s second residence
at Calcutta. Dr. Malan writes as follows:—
</p>
<p>“As regards Csoma de Körös, I never think of him without interest and gratitude. I
had heard of him, and seen his Tibetan Grammar and Dictionary before leaving England.
And one thing that used to make me think a five months’ voyage interminable was my
longing to become acquainted with one who had prepared the way for the acquisition
of a language of Asia, thought until then almost mythical. For neither Father Georgi’s
nor Abel Rémusat’s treatises went very far to clear the mystery.
</p>
<p>“One of my early visits, then, was to the Asiatic Society’s house [in Calcutta], where
Csoma lived as under-librarian.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e848src" href="#xd31e848">17</a> I found him a man of middle stature, of somewhat strange expression and features,
much weather-beaten from his travels, but kind, amiable, and willing to impart all
he knew. He was, however, very shy, and extremely disinterested. Although I had to
cross the river to come to him, I requested him at once to give me one lesson a week
in Tibetan, and he agreed to do so most readily. But I could not make him consent
to take any money. He told me to come as often as I liked, on the condition that his
teaching was to be free, for the pleasure and love of it. Of course this prevented
me from visiting him as frequently as I should otherwise have done, yet I went to
him for a lesson as often as I dared to do so. Although I frequently asked him to
come and stay in my house for change of air, I never could prevail upon him to come,
owing to his shyness and retiring habits. But as I happened to be the only person
who was troubling himself about Tibetan, he and I became very good friends during
the whole of my (alas! too short) stay in India. And <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xviii">[<a href="#pb.xviii">xviii</a>]</span>when we parted he gave me the whole of his Tibetan books, some thirty volumes. I value
such relics highly, and still use the same volume, containing his Grammar and Dictionary,
which I used to turn over with him.”
</p>
<p>Speaking of Csoma Körösi’s literary life at Calcutta, M. Pavie says, in the article
which has already been cited, “These labours occupied his time for the space of nine
years. He had turned his study into a sort of cell, from which he scarcely ever emerged,
except to walk up and down the long neighbouring galleries. It was there that, during
our stay in Bengal, we very frequently saw him, absorbed in a dreamy meditation, smiling
at his own thoughts, as silent as the Brahmans who were copying Sanskrit texts. He
had forgotten Europe to live amid the clouds of ancient Asia.”
</p>
<p>Early in 1842 Csoma Körösi left Calcutta, with the intention of revisiting Tibet,
and of making his way, if possible, to Lhasa, where he was in hopes of discovering
rich stores of Tibetan literature as yet unknown to the learned world. On the 24th
of March he arrived at Darjíling, in Nepal, where the superintendent of the station,
Dr. Archibald Campbell, did all he could to further his views. But on the 6th of April
he was attacked by fever, and on the 11th he died, a victim, as Professor Max Müller
has said, “to his heroic devotion to the study of ancient languages and religions.”
His wants, apart from literary requirements, appear to have been as few as those of
any monk, whether Christian or Buddhistic. “His effects,” says Dr. Campbell, “consisted
of four boxes of books and papers, the suit of blue clothes which he always wore,
and in which he died, a few shirts, and one cooking-pot. His food was confined to
tea, of which he was very fond, and plain boiled rice, of which he ate very little.
On a mat on the floor, with a box of books on the four sides, he sat, ate, slept,
and studied; never undressed at night, and rarely went out during the day. He never
drank wine or spirits, or used tobacco or other stimulants.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xix">[<a href="#pb.xix">xix</a>]</span></p>
<p>A few days before he died he gave Dr. Campbell “a rapid summary of the manner in which
he believed his native land was possessed by the original ‘Huns,’ and his reasons
for tracing them to Central or Eastern Asia.” Dr. Campbell gathered from his conversation
that “all his hopes of attaining the object of the long and laborious search were
centred in the discovery of the country of the ‘Yoogars.’ This land he believed to
be to the east and north of Lassa and the province of Kham, and on the northern confines
of China; to reach it was the goal of his most ardent wishes, and there he fully expected
to find the tribes he had hitherto sought in vain.” On the way he hoped to make great
literary discoveries, and he would dilate in the most enthusiastic manner “on the
delight he expected to derive from coming in contact with some of the learned men
of the East (Lassa), as the Lamas of Ladakh and Kānsun, with whom alone he had previous
communion, were confessedly inferior in learning to those of Eastern Tibet.” He was
generally reticent about the benefits which scholars might derive from his contemplated
journey, but “What would Hodgson, <span class="corr" id="xd31e859" title="Source: Tournour">Turnour</span>, and some of the philosophers of Europe not give to be in my place when I get to
Lassa!” was a frequent exclamation of his during his conversations with Dr. Campbell
before his illness.
</p>
<p>The Asiatic Society of Bengal at once placed a thousand rupees at the disposal of
Dr. Campbell for the erection of a monument above the remains of the Hungarian pilgrim.
And the Government of India has since given instructions that the grave of this genuine
and disinterested scholar shall be for all time placed under the care of the British
Resident at Darjíling.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e864src" href="#xd31e864">18</a>
</p>
<p>To the Hungarian enthusiast may be fairly applied, with a slight change, the words
which Professor Max <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xx">[<a href="#pb.xx">xx</a>]</span>Müller<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e871src" href="#xd31e871">19</a> has written with reference to Hiouen-thsang, the Chinese pilgrim, who spent so much
time “quietly pursuing among strangers, within the bleak walls of the cell of a Buddhist
college, the study of a foreign language,” that there was “something in his life and
the work of his life that places him by right among the heroes of Greece, the martyrs
of Rome, the knights of the Crusades, the explorers of the Arctic regions; something
that makes it a duty to inscribe his name on the roll of the worthies of the human
race.”
</p>
<p>Although the language and literature of Tibet occupied so much of Csoma Körösi’s time
and thoughts, yet the main object of his life was to work out the mysterious problem
as to the origin of the Hungarian nation. According to M. Jules Mohl, it was a remark
of Blumenbach’s about the possibility of discovering in Asia the original home of
the prehistoric ancestors of the Magyars, which first turned the attention to the
subject of the young Hungarian, who was then studying medicine at Göttingen. According
to Hunfalvy,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e876src" href="#xd31e876">20</a> his fancy may have been fired by De Guignes’s opinion, published a little before
1815, that the Huns had wandered from the western borders of the Chinese empire, first
to the neighbourhood of the Volga, and then on to Pannonia. But the fact of Csoma
Körösi being a Szekler by birth, says Hunfalvy, is regarded as one of the reasons
for his looking for the origin of his nation and language in the seat of the ancient
Huns. For the Hungarian chronicles had for centuries nourished in the Szeklers the
belief that they were the direct descendants of the Huns of Attila. In a letter which
he wrote home during his stay in Teheran, dated the 21st of December 1820, he said:—“Both
to satisfy <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxi">[<a href="#pb.xxi">xxi</a>]</span>my own desire, and to prove my gratitude and love to my nation, I have set off, and
must search for the origin of my nation according to the lights which I have kindled
in Germany, avoiding neither dangers that may perhaps occur, nor the distance I may
have to travel. Heaven has favoured my course, and if some great misfortune does not
happen to me, I shall within a short time be able to prove that my conviction was
founded upon no false basis.” During his stay in Calcutta, between his expeditions,
he experienced “the bitterest moments of his life,” being conscious that up to that
time he had fruitlessly looked for the origin of the Hungarians. It was that feeling,
says Hunfalvy, which drove him forth upon the pilgrimage which proved fatal to him.
“According to his conviction, the country inhabited by the Dsugur or Dzungar race,
dwelling to the north-east of Lhassa, on the western frontier of China, was the goal
which he had been seeking all his life, the region in which he might hope at length
to discover the Asiatic descendants of the ancestors of his Hungarian forefathers.”
The foundation of his hopes, as expressed a few days before his death to Dr. Campbell,
was as follows:—“In the dialects of Europe, the Sclavonic, Celtic, Saxon, and German,
I believe, the people who gave their name to the country now called Hungary were styled
Hunger or Ungur, Oongar or Yoongar; and in Arabic, Turkish, and Persian works there
are notices of a nation in Central Asia resembling in many respects the people who
came from the East into Hungary. In these languages they are styled Oogur, Woogur,
Voogur, or Yoogur, according to the pronunciation of the Persian letters; and from
the same works it might be inferred, he said, that the country of the Yoogurs was
situated as above noted.” His views, however, on this subject are not accepted by
his countrymen. His opinion “was based upon a false foundation,” says Hunfalvy, and
consequently his labours in that particular field have remained without result. But
as a scholar in <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxii">[<a href="#pb.xxii">xxii</a>]</span>general, as a specialist in everything which concerns Tibet, and as a single-minded,
self-sacrificing student, he is held in high honour in his native land, as may be
learnt from the oration which was delivered in his honour at Pest on the 8th of October
1843 by Baron Joseph Eötvos, who was at one time the Minister of Public Instruction
for Hungary.
</p>
<p>On this subject I have been favoured with a letter (in English) from the Hungarian
linguist and explorer Professor Arminius Vámbéry. In it, after stating that scarcely
anything is known in Hungary about the early years of Csoma Körösi, he proceeds to
say:—“We only know that it was the study of Oriental languages in Germany which gave
him the idea of the possibility of finding a people in Asia speaking our language,
and closely connected with us. This, of course, was a mistake, for Hungarian, a mixed
tongue consisting of an Ugrian and a Turko-Tatar dialect, has undergone two genetic
periods—one in the ancient seat between the Urals and the Volga, and another after
the settlement on Pannonia, where also large Slavonic elements inserted themselves.
It was thus a sheer impossibility to discover in Asia a language similar to ours,
although a considerable amount of affinity can be proved, partly in the Ugrian branch
(the Ostyak and the Vogul), partly in the Eastern Turkish, unadulterated by Persian
and Arab influence.
</p>
<p>“This knowledge, however, is the result of recent investigations, and poor Körösi
could have had hardly any notion of it. His unbounded love for science and for his
nation drove him to the East without a penny in his pocket, and most curious is the
account I heard from an old Hungarian, Count Teleky, regarding the outset of Körösi’s
travels. The Count was standing before the gate of his house in a village in Transylvania,
when he saw Körösi passing by, clad in a thin yellow nankin dress, with a stick in
his hand and a small bundle.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Where are you going, M. Körösi?’ asked the Count.
</p>
<p>“ ‘I am going to Asia in search of our relatives,’ was the answer.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxiii">[<a href="#pb.xxiii">xxiii</a>]</span></p>
<p>“And thus he really went … undergoing, as may easily be conceived, all the hardships
and privations of a traveller destitute of means, living upon alms, and exposed, besides,
to the bitter deception of not having found the looked-for relatives. And still he
went on in his unflagging zeal, until, assisted by your noble countrymen, he was able
to raise himself a memorial by his Tibetan studies.
</p>
<p>“I suppose that, when dying in Ladak … he always had his eyes directed to the steppes
north of Tibet, to the Tangus country, where, of course, he would have again been
disillusioned.
</p>
<p>“Körösi was therefore a victim to unripe philological speculation, like many other
Hungarian scholars unknown to the world. But his name will be always a glory to our
nation, and I am really glad to hear that [some one] … has devoted time to refresh
the memory of that great man.—Yours very sincerely,
</p>

</p>
<p>About the time when Csoma Körösi was starting from Bucharest on his adventurous pilgrimage,
another equally genuine and disinterested scholar, Mr. Brian Houghton Hodgson, was
commencing his long residence in Nepal. Living continuously in that country for three-and-twenty
years, and occupying from 1831 to 1843 the important post of British Resident at Kathmandu,
he was able to succeed in making the immense collections of Buddhistic works which
he afterwards, with a generosity as great as his industry, made gratuitously accessible
to European scholars. “The real beginning of an historical and critical study of the
doctrines of Buddha,” says Professor Max Müller (“Chips,” i. 190), “dates from the
year 1824. In that year Mr. Hodgson announced the fact that the original documents
of the Buddhist canon had been preserved in Sanskrit in the monasteries of Nepal.”
But there is no need to dwell here on the well-known fact that an immense amount of
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxiv">[<a href="#pb.xxiv">xxiv</a>]</span>such Sanskrit literature was discovered by Mr. Hodgson in Nepal, and presented to
the Royal Asiatic Society, the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and the <i lang="fr">Société Asiatique</i> of Paris. We have at present to deal only with the stores of information which he
extracted from Tibet. Mr. Hodgson not only established the fact, Professor Max Müller
goes on to say, “that some of the Sanskrit documents which he recovered had existed
in the monasteries of Nepal ever since the second century of our era,” but he also
showed that “the whole of that collection had, five or six hundred years later, when
Buddhism became definitely established in Tibet, been translated into the language
of that country.” Of the sacred canon of the Tibetans, translated into their language
from Sanskrit, Mr. Hodgson received a copy as a present from the Dalai Lama, and this
he presented to the East India Company. As early as 1828 he printed in the “Asiatic
Researches” (vol. xvi.) an article on Nepal and Tibet, in which he stated that “the
body of Bhotiya [<i>i.e.</i>, Tibetan] literature now is, and long has been, a mass of translations from Sanskrit;
its language native; its letters (like its ideas) Indian.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e918src" href="#xd31e918">21</a> To that statement he in 1837 appended this note: “It is needless now to say how fully
these views have been confirmed by the researches of De Körös. It is but justice to
myself to add that the real nature of the Kahgyur and Stangyur was expressly stated
and proved by me to the secretary of the Asiatic Society some time before M. De Körös’s
ample revelations were made. Complete copies of both collections have been presented
by me to the Honourable East India Company, and others procured for the Asiatic Society,
Calcutta: upon the latter M. De Körös worked.” It was a fortunate combination which
brought the special knowledge and the patient industry of Csoma Körösi into contact
with the immense mass of materials obtained by Mr. Hodgson from Tibet.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxv">[<a href="#pb.xxv">xxv</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of the sacred canon of the Tibetans the following description is given by Professor
Max Müller, who refers to Köppen’s “Religion des Buddha” as his authority:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e924src" href="#xd31e924">22</a>—“It consists of two collections, commonly called the Kanjur and Tanjur. The proper
spelling of their names is Bkah-hgyur, pronounced Kah-gyur,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e927src" href="#xd31e927">23</a> and Bstan-hgyur, pronounced Tan-gyur. The Kanjur consists, in its different editions,
of 100, 102, or 108 volumes folio. It comprises 1083 distinct works. The Tanjur consists
of 225 volumes folio, each weighing from four to five pounds in the edition of Peking.
Editions of this colossal code were printed at Peking, Lhassa, and other places. The
edition of the Kanjur published at Peking, by command of the Emperor Khian-Lung, sold
for £600. A copy of the Kanjur was bartered for 7000 oxen by the Buriates, and the
same tribe paid 1200 silver roubles for a complete copy of the Kanjur and Tanjur together.
Such a jungle of religious literature—the most excellent hiding-place, we should think,
for Lamas and Dalai-Lamas—was too much even for a man who could travel on foot from
Hungary to Tibet. The Hungarian enthusiast, however, though he did not translate the
whole, gave a most valuable analysis of this immense Bible in the seventeenth volume
of the ‘Asiatic Researches,’ sufficient to establish the fact that the principal portion
of it was a translation from the same Sanskrit originals which had been discovered
in Nepal by Mr. Hodgson.”
</p>
<p>The Sanskrit works which Mr. Hodgson so generously presented to the Asiatic Society
of Paris were soon turned to good account. From them M. Eugène Burnouf drew the materials
for his celebrated “<span lang="fr">Introduction à l’Histoire du Buddhisme Indien.</span>” But of the Tibetan sacred writings, <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxvi">[<a href="#pb.xxvi">xxvi</a>]</span>which were also rendered available to European students, no great use has ever been
made except by two scholars. Csoma Körösi, as has been already stated, published an
“Analysis of the Tibetan Work entitled the Kah-gyur,” and an “Abstract of the Contents
of the <i>B</i>stan-<i>h</i>gyur;” and M.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;E. Foucaux brought out at Paris in 1847 his “<span lang="fr">Rgya Tch’er Rol Pa, ou Développement des Jeux, contenant l’Histoire du Bouddha Çakya-Mouni,
traduit sur la Version Tibétaine du Bhahhgyour, et Revu sur l’Original Sanskrit (Lalitavistâra).</span>” M. Foucaux’s excellent work is too well known to require more than a passing notice
here. But as Csoma Körösi’s Analyses are probably less familiar, it may be well to
extract from them a short account of the different sections of the colossal Tibetan
collection.
</p>
<p>The first of its two parts, he remarks, is styled Ká-gyur, or vulgarly Kán-gyur,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e957src" href="#xd31e957">24</a> <i>i.e</i>., “Translation of Commandments,” being versions of Sanskrit writings imported into
Tibet, and translated there between the seventh and thirteenth centuries, but mostly
in the ninth. The copy on which he worked at Calcutta, consisting of 100 volumes,
“appears to have been printed with the very wooden types that are mentioned as having
been prepared in 1731.” This first part comprises seven divisions, which are in fact
distinct works. These he names as follows:—
</p>
<p>1. <i>Dulvá</i> (“Discipline,” Sanskrit <i>Vinaya</i>). This division occupies thirteen volumes, and deals with religious discipline and
the education of persons who adopt the religious life. It is subdivided into seven
parts as follows:—
</p>
<ul>
<li>1. “The Basis of Discipline or Education.” 4 vols. </li>
<li>2. “A Sútra on Emancipation.” 30 leaves. </li>
<li>3. “Explanation of Education.” 4 vols. </li>
<li>4. “A Sútra on Emancipation for the Priestesses or Nuns.” 36 leaves. </li>
<li>5. “Explanation of the Discipline or Education of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxvii">[<a href="#pb.xxvii">xxvii</a>]</span>Priestesses or Nuns, in one volume with the preceding tract.” </li>
<li>6. “Miscellaneous Minutiæ concerning Religious Discipline.” 2 vols. </li>
<li>7. The chief text-book (or the last work of the Dulvá class) on education. 2 vols.
</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>2. “<i>Shés-rab-kyi-p’ha-rol-tu-p’hyin-pa</i> (by contraction <i>Shér-p’hyin</i>, pronounced <i>Sher-ch’hin</i>), Sans. <i>Prajná páramitá</i>, Eng. ‘Transcendental wisdom.’ ” This division occupies twenty-one volumes, which
all “treat of speculative or theoretical philosophy, <i>i.e.</i>, they contain the psychological, logical, and metaphysical terminology of the Buddhists,
without entering into the discussion of any particular subject.”
</p>
<p>3. “<i>Sangs-rgyas-p’hal-po-ch’hè</i>, or by contraction <i>P’hal-ch’hen</i>, Sans. <i>Buddhāvataṇsaka</i>, … Association of Buddhas, or of those grown wise.” This division contains six volumes,
the subject of the whole being “moral doctrine and metaphysics. There are descriptions
of several <i>Tathágatas</i> or Buddhas, their provinces, their great qualifications, their former performances
for promoting the welfare of all animal beings, their praises, and several legends.
Enumeration of several <i>Bodhisatwas</i>, the several degrees of their perfections, their practices or manners of life, their
wishes, prayers, and efforts for making happy all animal beings.”
</p>
<p>4. “D<i>kon</i>-m<i>ch’hog</i>-br<i>tségs-pa</i>, or by contraction D<i>kon</i>-br<i>tségs</i> (pronounced <i>kon-tségs</i>). In Sans. <i>Ratna-kúṭa</i>, the ‘Jewel-peak,’ or precious things heaped up, or enumeration of several qualities
and perfections of Buddha and his instructions. The subject, as in the former division,
still consists of morals and metaphysics, mixed with many legends and collections
of the tenets of the Buddhistic doctrine.”
</p>
<p>5. “M<i>do-sdé</i> (Sans. <i>Sútránta</i>), or simply M<i>do</i> (Sans. <i>Sútra</i>), signifying a treatise or aphorism on any subject. In a general sense, when the
whole <i>Káh-gyur</i> is divided <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxviii">[<a href="#pb.xxviii">xxviii</a>]</span>into two parts, M<i>do</i> and R<i>gyud</i>, all the other divisions except the R<i>gyud</i> are comprehended in the M<i>do</i> class. But in a particular sense there are some treatises which have been arranged
or put under this title. They amount to about 270, and are contained in thirty volumes.
The subject of the works contained in these thirty volumes is various.… The greatest
part of them consist of the moral and metaphysical doctrine of the Buddhistic system,
the legendary accounts of several individuals, with allusions to the sixty or sixty-four
arts, to medicine, astronomy, and astrology. There are many stories to exemplify the
consequences of actions in former transmigrations, descriptions of orthodox and heterodox
theories, moral and civil laws, the six kinds of animal beings, the places of their
habitations, and the causes of their being born there; cosmogony and cosmography according
to the Buddhistic notions, the provinces of several Buddhas, exemplary conduct of
life of any <i>Bodhisatwa</i> or saint, <i>etc.</i>” It is the second volume of this section which M. Foucaux has translated.
</p>
<p>6. “<i>Mya-n̄an-las-</i>h<i>das-pa</i>, or by contraction <i>Myang-</i>h<i>das</i> (Sans. <i>Nirváṇa</i>),<span id="xd31e1067"></span> two vols. The title of these two volumes is in Sanskrit <i>Mahá parinirváṇa sútra</i>.… A <i>sútra</i> on the entire deliverance from pain. Subject, Shákya’s death under a pair of <i>Sál</i> trees near the city of <i>Kusha</i> or <i>Kámarúpa</i>, in <i>Assam</i>. Great lamentation of all sorts of animal beings on the approaching death of Shákya,
their offerings or sacrifices presented to him, his lessons, especially with regard
to the soul. His last moments, his funeral, how his relics were divided, and where
deposited.”

<p>7. “R<i>gyud</i>-s<i>dé</i>, or simply R<i>gyud</i>, Sans. <i>Tantra</i>, or the Tantra class, in twenty-two volumes. These volumes in general contain mystical
theology. There are descriptions of several gods and goddesses, instructions for preparing

</p>
<p>Of the second great division of the Tibetan sacred books Csoma Körösi gives only a
brief abstract, “without mentioning the Sanscrit titles of the works” from which its
contents have been translated. It will be sufficient to quote the opening lines of
his article.
</p>
<p>“The B<i>stan</i>-H<i>gyur</i> is a compilation in Tibetan of all sorts of literary works, written mostly by ancient
Indian <i>Pandits</i> and some learned Tibetans, in the first centuries after the introduction of Buddhism
into Tibet, commencing with the seventh century of our era. The whole makes 225 volumes.
It is divided into <span class="corr" id="xd31e1106" title="Not in source">two </span>classes, the R<i>gyud</i> and M<i>do</i> (<i>Tantra</i> and <i>Sútra</i> classes in Sanscrit). The R<i>gyud</i>, mostly on <i>tantrika</i> rituals and ceremonies, makes 87 volumes. The M<i>do</i>, on science and literature, occupies 136 volumes. One separate volume contains hymns
or praises on several deities and saints, and one volume is the index for the whole.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1124src" href="#xd31e1124">25</a>

</p>
<p>In the year 1830, while Csoma Körösi was still pursuing his studies in the monasteries
of Western Tibet, a Russian official, Baron Schilling de Canstadt, was beginning to
look for Tibetan books in Eastern Siberia. His first visit, he says,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1150src" href="#xd31e1150">26</a> to the monastery of Tchikoï, twelve leagues from Kiachta, the town in which he was
stationed, made him aware that it possessed a copy of the Kah-gyur, as well as other
sacred books, which were ranged on either side of <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxx">[<a href="#pb.xxx">xxx</a>]</span>the altar, wrapped in red and yellow coverings. As the Russian ecclesiastical mission
to Pekin was then on the point of starting from Kiachta, he offered to obtain by its
means from China such books as the priests might require. They gladly accepted his
offer, and made out lists of Tibetan books, which proved of great service to him,
especially after they had been supplemented by the additions which were made by a
Lama who visited him at Kiachta. He still further ingratiated himself with the priests
by presenting them with a <i>lo</i> or <i>tum-tum</i>, which he procured from the nearest Chinese town, as well as by the respect he showed
for their sacred books. For when he was allowed to handle a volume of their copy of
the Kah-gyur, he took care to touch the margins only of the leaves, not the holy printed
part.
</p>
<p>It happened that the chief of a tribe of Tsongols possessed a copy of a part of the
Kah-gyur, and this he gave to the appreciative stranger, who rose still higher in
the opinion of the natives when they found that he had ordered a silken wrapper to
be made for each of the volumes presented to him. He himself was delighted, he says,
at becoming “the proprietor of the first Tibetan work of any length which had up to
that time passed into the hands of a European.” After all this he was well received
wherever he went. A prediction had been made a year before that a foreign convert
to Buddhism, destined to spread that religion in the West, was about to visit Mongolia,
and this prophecy was interpreted in his favour. The Buriat Lamas even looked upon
him as “a Khoubil-ghan, an incarnation of an important personage in the Buddhist Pantheon.”
After a time he organised a band of copyists, sometimes twenty in number, who lived
in tents in his courtyard, and frequently consumed as much as a hundred pounds of
beef in a day, besides much brick tea, a caldron being kept always on the boil for
their use. At the end of a year he possessed a collection of <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxi">[<a href="#pb.xxxi">xxxi</a>]</span>Mongol and Tibetan books, containing two thousand works and separate treatises.
</p>
<p>Happening to visit the temple of Subulin, he found that the Lamas were manufacturing
an enormous prayer wheel. He offered to get the printing of the oft-repeated prayer
done for them at St. Petersburg, whereby their machine would be rendered far more
efficacious than if they trusted to native typography. They accepted his offer gladly,
and to prove their gratitude, presented to him, in the name of the tribe, a complete
copy of the Kah-gyur which they possessed, having obtained it from a Mongol Lama.
Both parties to this transaction were equally pleased; for when the printed leaves
came from St. Petersburg, it was found that each of them contained 2500 repetitions
of the sacred formula, and the words were printed in red ink, which is 108 times more
efficacious than black; and the paper itself was stamped with the same words instead
of bearing the maker’s name. So the Buriates were charmed, and so was the European
bibliophile, who had got possession of what he had scarcely hoped ever to obtain,
a copy of the Kah-gyur in 101 volumes, printed in the monastery of Nartang in Western
Tibet. This copy, after the death of Baron Schilling de Canstadt, was purchased from
his heirs by the Emperor Nicholas, and presented to the Academy of Sciences.
</p>
<p>M. Vasilief, the well-known author of the “History of Buddhism,” which has been translated
from Russian into French and German, says<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1172src" href="#xd31e1172">27</a> that when he was at Pekin he made inquiries about the Kah-gyur and Tan-gyur, and
he was shown the building in which they used to be printed. But no edition, he was
told, had been brought out for some time. Some of the wood blocks were lost, others
had suffered injury. However, a copy of each work was procured by the Chinese Government
and presented to <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxii">[<a href="#pb.xxxii">xxxii</a>]</span>the Russian mission. These copies are now in St. Petersburg. The Mongol Buriates of
Russia, M. Vasilief states, are even more devoted to their religion, and look to Lhassa
more longingly than their kinsmen in Mongolia itself. They read their sacred books,
or hear them read, in Tibetan, and are edified, even though they do not comprehend.
Any one who wishes to command a reading of the Kah-gyur or Tan-gyur addresses himself
to one of the monasteries which possess those works, pays a certain price, and provides
tea for the Lamas. A reading of the Kah-gyur, it seems, used to come to about fifteen
pounds at one of the monasteries, exclusive of tea. At a given signal all the Lamas
flock together, and take their places according to seniority. Before each are placed
a number of leaves of the work, and off they set, all reading at once, so that the
entire performance occupies only a few hours, after which each reader receives his
share of the offering made by the orderer of the function.
</p>
<p>Of the Russian scholars who availed themselves of the presence of the two editions
of the Kah-gyur at St. Petersburg, the most enthusiastic and industrious was the late
Professor Anton von Schiefner. From the Dulvā, the first of the seven divisions of
that work, he translated into German the legends and tales, an English version of
which is contained in the present volume. His German versions all appeared in the
“<span lang="fr">Mélanges Asiatiques tirés du Bulletin de l’Académie Impériale des Sciences de St.
Pétersbourg</span>” (tom. vi.–viii.), with the exceptions of Nos. 2 and 5, which were published in the
“<span lang="fr">Mémoires</span>” of that Society (series vii., tom. xix., No. 6). Professor Schiefner, if he had
lived another year, would have doubtless supplied a number of additional notes, and
would have written an Introduction to the work. His lamented death on November 16,
1880, has deprived the present volume of what would probably have been one of its
most interesting parts. It was at Professor Schiefner’s express wish that the present
translation was undertaken. It <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxiii">[<a href="#pb.xxxiii">xxxiii</a>]</span>must be a subject of universal regret that he did not live to witness its appearance
in print. The following tribute to his merits as a scholar was contributed, soon after
his death, by Professor Albrecht Weber to “Trübner’s Record.”
</p>
<p>“Professor F. Anton von Schiefner was a distinguished scholar of most various attainments.
His specialty, however, was Tibetan, and more particularly the investigation of Buddhist
legends of Indian and Occidental origin, a collection of which in English will soon
be published by Messrs. Trübner &amp; Co. He had, moreover, devoted himself with rare
perseverance and disinterestedness to the utilisation and publication of the labours
of two scholars whose own restless activity would, without him, have been almost entirely
lost to the scientific world—namely, those of the Finnic linguist, Alexander Castrèn,
and of the Caucasian linguist, Baron von Uslar. One might—<i>sit venia verbo</i>—almost say that both men had found in Schiefner their Homer. He edited the labours
of Castrèn almost wholly from the posthumous papers of that brave and modest man,
who, from 1838 to 1849, explored, under the greatest privations, the inhospitable
regions of Norway, Lapland, and Siberia, where the tribes of the Finnic race are seated.
Castrèn’s <i lang="de">Reiseerinnerungen</i> and <i lang="de">Reiseberichte</i>, edited by Schiefner, present a vivid picture of the hardships Castrèn had to go
through, and which finally caused his premature death, in 1852, at the age of thirty-nine.
We have lying before us the twelve volumes of his Samoyedan and Tungusian Grammars
and Vocabularies, as well as those of the languages of the Buryats, Koibals, Karagasses,
Ostyaks, &amp;c.; his ethnological lectures on the Altaic races, and those on Finnic mythology—all
worked out by Schiefner’s deft hand, and edited by him from 1835 to 1861. In connection
therewith Schiefner also made a German translation of the Finnic national epos <i>Kalevala</i>, and also one of the Hero-Sagas of the Minussin Tatars. Schiefner was more advantageously
situated in <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxiv">[<a href="#pb.xxxiv">xxxiv</a>]</span>working up the collections of the estimable Caucasian linguist, Major-General von
Uslar (1816 to 1873), written in the Russian language, with whom, until the General’s
death, he was always able to confer directly. While Schiefner’s own and entirely independent
work on the Thush language (1856), by the accuracy with which a hitherto quite uncultivated
and altogether strange department was opened to linguistic investigation, had obtained
for the author general appreciation, the united efforts of both scholars have furnished
surprising results as regards these highly peculiar languages of the Caucasian mountaineers—the
Avares, Abchases, Tchetchenzes, Kasikumüks, Kurines—which by their extraordinary sounds,
as well as by their most singular grammatical structure, produce so very strange an
impression. The personal intercourse with soldiers of Caucasian origin, garrisoned
at St. Petersburg, was herein of high importance to Schiefner. His amiable and open
manner in personal intercourse, characteristic of the whole man, bore him excellent
fruit in this case. Science, and especially the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences,
has by Schiefner’s death sustained a heavy, indeed a quite irreparable, loss.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1205src" href="#xd31e1205">28</a>
</p>
<p>The edition of the Kah-gyur on which Professor Schiefner worked appears (says M. Vasilief,
the author of the “History of Buddhism”) to have been that in 108 volumes, printed
at Pekin during the eighteenth century, and presented to the Asiatic Museum of the
St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences by the Asiatic Department of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, which had received it, about the year 1850, from the Russian Mission in China.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxv">[<a href="#pb.xxxv">xxxv</a>]</span></p>
<p>The notes to the present volume signed S. are by Professor Schiefner. A few others
have been added, consisting for the most part of extracts from Professor Monier Williams’s
Sanskrit Dictionary. The forms of Indian names adopted by Professor Schiefner have
been retained in the English translation, with certain modifications—<i>y</i> being substituted for <i>j</i>, for instance, <i>ch</i> for <i>tsh</i>, and <i>j</i> for <i>dsh</i>. It ought to be stated that Professor Schiefner made several important corrections
on the sheets which he prepared for the use of his English translator, and therefore
the English version will sometimes be found to differ materially from the German text.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1229src" href="#xd31e1229">29</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxvi">[<a href="#pb.xxxvi">xxxvi</a>]</span></p>
<p>To European folk-tales the longer legends of the Kahgyur bear but little resemblance,
though many of the fables about animals, and other short stories towards the end of
the present volume, have their counterparts in the West. Here and there, however,
even in the long narratives of the legendary class, certain features may be recognised
as being common to both Europe and Asia. The moral of King Māndhātar’s story (No.
1), for instance, seems to be identical, different as is its machinery, with that
of a story which is current in many Western lands. That monarch, after conquering
the whole earth, ascends into the heavenly home of the thirty-three gods, and is allowed
to share the throne of their chief, Śakra or Indra. But at last he wishes for too
much. “He came to the conclusion that he must expel the king of the gods, Śakra, from
his throne, and take into his own hands the government of both gods and men.” As soon
as he had conceived this idea, “the great King Māndhātar came to the end of his good
fortune,” and soon afterwards he died. The most familiar form of the European story,
which inculcates a similar moral teaching, is the German tale of “The Fisherman and
his Wife” (the 19th of Grimm’s Collection). In it, a grateful fish for a long time
accedes to every desire expressed by the fisherman. He and his wife become first rich,
then noble, and eventually royal. But the fisherman’s wife is not satisfied with being
a queen. She wishes to be the Pope, and the fish fulfils her desire. Even then she
is discontented, and at last she demands to be made God. When the fish is told this
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxvii">[<a href="#pb.xxxvii">xxxvii</a>]</span>by her husband, it replies, “Go back, and you will find her in her hovel.” The fisherman’s
good fortune has come to an end. He and his wife are poor folks once more. In a Hesse
variant the husband’s final wish is, “Let me be God, and my wife the Mother of God.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1291src" href="#xd31e1291">30</a>
</p>
<p>A curious parallel to one of the incidents in King Māndhātar’s story is afforded by
a Polynesian myth. On the crown of King Utposhadha’s head, according to the Tibetan
tale, “there grew a very soft tumour, somewhat resembling a cushion of cotton or wool,
without doing him any harm. When it had become quite ripe and had broken, there came
forth from it a boy, shapely and handsome.” Mr. Gill tells us in his interesting “Myths
and Songs from the South Pacific” (p. 10), that Tangaroa and Rongo were the children
of Vātea, the father of gods and men, and his wife Papa. “Tangaroa should have been
born first, but gave precedence to his brother Rongo. A few days after the birth of
Rongo, his mother Papa suffered from a very large boil on her arm. She resolved to
get rid of it by pressing it. The core accordingly flew out; it was Tangaroa! Another
account, equally veracious, says that Tangaroa came right up through Papa’s head.
The precise spot is indicated by ‘<i>the crown</i>’ with which all their descendants have since been born.” Professor Schiefner mentions
that a suggestion has been made to the effect that “the name of Utposhadha may be
a transformation of the Greek Hephæstus, though the part which the latter plays in
the Greek myth at the birth of Athene is of a different nature.” But this seems to
be going unnecessarily far.
</p>
<p>The story of Kuśa, No. 2, may be linked with the numerous European variants of the
tale which we know so well under the title of “Beauty and the Beast.” The principal
feature of that tale is the union of a beautiful maiden with a monster of some kind,
whose monstrosity is eventually <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxviii">[<a href="#pb.xxxviii">xxxviii</a>]</span>cured by her love and devotion. The Beast with whom the Beauty is linked is generally
a supernatural monster, and possesses the power of at times divesting itself of its
monstrous or bestial envelope or husk, and appearing in its real form as a fairy prince
or other brilliant being. It is, as a general rule, only at night in the dark that
this transformation takes place. In some cases, as in the Cupid and Psyche story,
the wife is forbidden to look upon her husband. He visits her only in utter darkness.
But in many versions of the story she is allowed to see her pseudo-monster in all
his brilliant beauty. He is often a deity, whom some superior divinity has degraded
from the sky and compelled to live upon earth under a monstrous shape. One day the
wife lays her hands on her husband’s monstrous envelope or husk and destroys it. The
spell being thus broken, the husband either flies away to heaven or remains living
on earth in uninterrupted beauty.
</p>
<p>In some of the European variants, the original idea having apparently been forgotten,
the transformation appears not only grotesque but unreasonable. Thus in a Wallachian
tale (Schott, No. 23), a princess is married to “a pumpkin,” or at least to a youth
who is a pumpkin by day. Wishing to improve her husband, she one day puts him in the
oven and bakes him, whereupon he disappears for ever. In a German story (Grimm, No.
127), a princess who has lost her way in a wood is induced to marry an iron stove.
But the disfiguring “husk” is in most cases the hide or skin of some inferior animal,
an ass, a monkey, a frog, or the like, or else the outside of a hideous man. Sometimes
it is a brilliant female being who is after this fashion “translated.” Thus an Indian
story<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1304src" href="#xd31e1304">31</a> tells of a prince who was obliged to take a monkey as his wife. But when she liked
she could slip out of her monkey skin and appear as a beautiful woman arrayed in the
most magnificent apparel. She adjured her husband to take <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxix">[<a href="#pb.xxxix">xxxix</a>]</span>great care of her “husk” during her absence from it. But one day he burnt it, hoping
to force her to be always beautiful. She shrieked “I burn!” and disappeared. In a
Russian variant of the same story a prince is compelled to marry a frog, which is
“held in a bowl” while the marriage service is being performed. But when it so pleases
her, his frog-wife “flings off her skin and becomes a fair maiden.” One day he burns
her “husk,” and she disappears. In the Tibetan story of Kuśa, the “Beast” is merely
an ugly man disfigured by “the eighteen signs of uncomeliness.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1312src" href="#xd31e1312">32</a> On that account it was decided that “he must never be allowed to approach his wife
by daylight.” But she caught sight of him one day, and her suspicions were aroused.
So she hid away a lighted lamp in her room, uncovered it suddenly when her husband
was with her, shrieked out that he was a demon, and fled away. After a time, however,
won by his military reputation, she said to herself, “As this youth Kuśa is excellently
endowed with boldness and courage, why should I dislike him?” And straightway “she
took a liking for him,” just as the Beauty of the fairy-tale did for the Beast. It
may be worth noticing that the conch-shell which Kuśa sounds with such force that
the ears of his enemies are shattered, and they are either killed or put to flight,
finds a Russian parallel in the whistle employed by the brigand Solovei, or Nightingale,
whom Ilya of Murom overcomes. In the builmas, or Russian metrical romances, he often
figures; and when he sounds his whistle his enemies fall to the ground, nearly or
quite dead.
</p>
<p>No. 3, which chronicles some of the wise judgments of King Ādarśamukha, comprises
two different stories—the first narrating the ingenuity with which the king satisfied
the demands of a number of complainants without injuring the man who had involuntarily
given rise to their complaints; <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xl">[<a href="#pb.xl">xl</a>]</span>the second describing a journey made by a traveller who was commissioned by various
persons, animals, or other objects, passed by him on his way, to ask certain questions
on his arrival at his destination. The latter story is one which is familiar to Eastern
Europe. In one of its Russian variants a peasant hospitably receives an old beggar,
who adopts him as his brother, and invites him to pay him a visit. On his way to the
beggar’s home, he is appealed to by children, who say, “Christ’s brother, ask Christ
whether we must suffer here long.” Later on, girls engaged in ladling water from one
well into another beg him to ask the same question on their account. When he arrives
at his journey’s end he becomes aware that his beggar friend is Christ himself; and
he is informed that the children he had passed on the way had been cursed by their
mothers while still unborn, and so were unable to enter Paradise; and the girls had,
while they were alive, adulterated the milk they sold with water, and were therefore
condemned to an eternal punishment resembling that of the Danaides (Afanasief, “Legendui,”
No. 8). The judgments attributed in the Tibetan tale to King Ādarśamukha, and in another
Tibetan work, the “Dsanglun” (as Professor Schiefner has remarked) to King <i>M</i>dges-pa, form the subject of a story well known in Russia under the title of “Shemyakin
Sud,” or “Shemyaka’s Judgment.” It exists there as a folk-tale, but it belongs to
what may be called the chap-book literature of the country, and it is derived from
literary sources. A variant given by Afanasief (“Skazki,” v., No. 19) closely resembles
part of the Tibetan tale. A poor man borrowed from his rich brother a pair of oxen,
with which he ploughed his plot of ground. Coming away from the field he met an old
man, who asked to whom the oxen belonged. “To my brother,” was the reply. “Your brother
is rich and stingy,” said the old man; “choose which you will, either his son shall
die or his oxen.” The poor man thought and thought. He was sorry both for the oxen
and for his brother’s son. <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xli">[<a href="#pb.xli">xli</a>]</span>At last he said, “Better let the oxen die.” “Be it as you wish,” said the old man.
When the poor man reached his home the oxen suddenly fell down dead. The rich brother
accused him of having worked them to death, and carried him off to the king. On his
way to the king’s court the poor man, according to the chap-book version (“Skazki,”
viii. p. 325), accidentally sat down upon a baby and killed it, and tried to commit
suicide by jumping off a bridge, but only succeeded in crushing an old man whose son
was taking him into the river for a bath. He had also had the misfortune to pull off
a horse’s tail without meaning it. When summoned into court for all these involuntary
offences, he took a stone in his pocket tied up in a handkerchief, and stealthily
produced it when he was had up before the judge, saying to himself, “If the judge
goes against me I will kill him with this.” The judge fancied that the stone was a
bribe of a hundred roubles which the defendant wished to offer him; so he gave judgment
in his favour in each case. The poor man was to keep his brother’s horse until its
tail grew again, and to marry the woman whose child he had crushed, and to stand under
the bridge from which he had jumped and allow the son of the man he had killed to
jump off the bridge on to him. The owner of the horse, the husband of the woman, and
the son of the crushed man were all glad to buy off the culprit whom they had brought
up for judgment. The satirical turn of the story and the allusion to bribe-taking
are characteristic features of the Russian variants of this well-known Eastern tale.
The Russian story takes its title from the notorious injustice and oppression of Prince
Demetrius Shemyaka, who blinded his cousin, Vasily II., Grand Prince of Moscow, and
for a time usurped his throne. To this day an unjust legal decision is known as a
Shemyaka judgment. But in the Eastern versions of the story, which are numerous, there
is no mention of injustice; stupidity, however, is sometimes attributed by them to
the judge. Thus in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xlii">[<a href="#pb.xlii">xlii</a>]</span>Kathá Sarit Ságara<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1325src" href="#xd31e1325">33</a> the story of Devabhúti tells how the excellent wife of the learned Brahman of that
name “went into the kitchen garden to get vegetables, and saw a donkey belonging to
a washerman eating them. So she took up a stick and ran after the donkey, and the
animal fell into a pit as it was trying to escape and broke its hoof. When its master
heard of that, he came in a passion and beat with a stick and kicked the Brahman woman.
Accordingly she, being pregnant, had a miscarriage, but the washerman returned home
with his donkey. Then her husband, hearing of it, came home after bathing, and, after
seeing his wife, went in his distress and complained to the chief magistrate of the
town. The foolish man immediately had the washerman, whose name was Balásura, brought
before him, and, after hearing the pleadings of both parties, delivered this judgment:
‘Since the donkey’s hoof is broken, let the Bráhman carry the donkey’s load for the
washerman until the donkey is again fit for work, and let the washerman make the Bráhman’s
wife pregnant again, since he made her miscarry. Let this be the punishment of the
two parties respectively.’ When the Bráhman heard this, he and his wife in their despair
took poison and died. And when the king heard of it, he put to death that inconsiderate
judge.”
</p>
<p>As they deal with the subject of wise judgment, the seventh and eighth stories may
be spoken of next. One of them describes the cleverness of a girl, the other that
of a lad. Each of them is very popular in the East, and both of them find more or
less complete counterparts in the West. There is a well-known group of folk-tales
familiar to most European and Asiatic lands, the theme of which is the sharpness of
a woman’s wits. Just as there thrive among the common people of all countries many
jeers and flouts against women, such as the proverbs <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xliii">[<a href="#pb.xliii">xliii</a>]</span>“A woman’s hair is long, but her mind is short,” and “A woman is worse than a dog,
for <i>it</i> does not bark at its master,” or stories illustrative of a wife’s obstinacy, folly,
or perfidy, so there flourish by their side numerous popular arguments in favour of
women, generally conveyed in the form of stories. In the Perso-Turkish story-book
of “The Forty Viziers,” a tale accusing women frequently alternates with one told
in their defence. The framework of the collection is as follows:—A wicked queen calumniates
her stepson as Phædra calumniated Hippolytus. His father sentences him to death. But
the forty ministers intercede for him, each of them daily telling a tale of which
the aim generally is to show how little reliance can be placed on a woman. Each night
the queen tells a story which is usually of quite the opposite tendency, pointing
out that men are miserable creatures, and that they are morally inferior to women.
At the end of the forty days and nights, the prince is allowed to speak in his own
defence (having been during that period prohibited by the astrologers from opening
his lips), and all goes well. Among encomiums upon women, the story of Viśākhā (forming
No. 7 of the present collection and a part of No. 8) is entitled to rank high. Her
discretion, intelligence, and thoughtfulness for others, entitle her to an honourable
place among the heroines of popular fiction. One of her decisions of a knotty legal
point is specially interesting, as it belongs to the cycle of which Solomon’s judgments
in the case of the two disputing mothers is the best known example. The actual mother
and the adopted mother of a boy dispute as to which is really his mother. The point
is legally important, for with the possession of the boy goes that of his deceased
father’s homestead. The case is referred to the king, whose ministers investigate
it, but in vain. At length Viśākhā is consulted. She replies, “What need is there
of investigation? Speak to the two women thus: ‘As we do not know to which of you
two the boy belongs, let who is the strongest take the <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xliv">[<a href="#pb.xliv">xliv</a>]</span>boy.’ When each of them has laid hold of one of the boy’s hands and he begins to cry
out on account of the pain, the real mother will let go, being full of compassion
for him, and knowing that if her child remains alive she will be able to see it again.
But the other, who has no compassion for him, will not let go.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1340src" href="#xd31e1340">34</a> Professor Schiefner has called attention in a note to the article in “<span lang="de">Ausland</span>” by the late Professor Benfey on the somewhat similar tale of “<span lang="de">Die Kluge Dirne</span>,” and to the variant of the Viśākhā story given in Mr. Spence Hardy’s “Manual of
Buddhism.” There is a well-known folk-tale about a woman’s intelligence, of which
the Russian variant may be cited here. It is the 6th of Khudyakoff’s collection of
“Great Russian Popular Tales” (Moscow, 1860). A peasant girl was so intelligent that
she solved all the problems proposed to her by a certain judge. Charmed by her cleverness,
he married her. But he stipulated that if she ever found fault with any of his legal
decisions she was to be divorced, and was bound to return at once to her father’s
cottage. Only she was to be allowed to take away with her whatever thing she liked
best in her husband’s house. All went well for some time with the judge and his clever
wife. At length she heard him deliver a preposterous judgment in court, and she could
not help protesting against it. Accordingly she was ordered to return to her father’s
hut. She obeyed, but she took with her the judge, to whom she had administered so
much liquor before leaving, that she was able to drive him in a cart tranquilly sleeping.
When he awoke, and found himself in his father-in-law’s cottage, he naturally asked
how he got there. “I brought you away with me,” replied the divorced wife. “You know
I was entitled to take away whatever I liked best in your house, and I chose you.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1350src" href="#xd31e1350">35</a> There is a very interesting story of the same kind in <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xlv">[<a href="#pb.xlv">xlv</a>]</span>Radloff’s great collection of songs and tales from Central Asia (“<span lang="de">Proben der Volkslitteratur der türkischen Stämme Sud-Sibiriens</span>,” vol. iii. pp. 347–354). There was once a choleric khan who understood the language
of birds. He ordered his vizier one day to find out what two geese had said to each
other as they flew past, threatening to put him to death if he failed to do so. The
vizier applied for help to the khan’s wise daughter, who gave him the information
he required. He promised not to mention his informant, but he broke his promise. The
khan was so angry with his daughter, when he found out that it was she who had told
the vizier what the geese had said, that he gave her in marriage to the most miserable
specimen of humanity he could find. She proved an excellent wife to her unsightly
and poverty-stricken husband, and he and she prospered in consequence.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1358src" href="#xd31e1358">36</a>
</p>
<p>The story of the cleverness of Mahaushadha (No. 8) forms the counterpart of that of
Viśākhā, who herself plays a part in the tale, which is told at somewhat tedious length.
Some of its incidents will be familiar to readers of Western folk-tales. Professor
Schiefner has called attention (in a footnote to page 129) to several variants of
the story of the mystic fowl—sometimes a cock, sometimes a hen or goose, a layer of
golden eggs—the eater of which is destined to become a king. It forms the opening
of the German story of “The Two Brothers” (Grimm, No. 60, vol. iii. pp. 102–107);
but in it the peculiarity of the bird is stated to be that the eating of its heart
and liver enables the eater to become rich. Three Russian variants of the story are
given by Afanasief in his collection of “Russian Popular Tales” (v., No. 53, viii.,
No. 26, and pp. 464–7). In all of them the eater of the bird or a part of it becomes
a king. Many mythologists<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1363src" href="#xd31e1363">37</a> recognise <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xlvi">[<a href="#pb.xlvi">xlvi</a>]</span>in the golden egg the Sun, which may be looked upon as a gleaming egg laid every morning
by the brooding Night. But the king-making power attributed to the bird’s eaten flesh
remains a mystery. In the story of Mahaushadha, the boy Bahvannapāna, who has eaten
the head of the mystic cock, is elected king by the ministers at a certain court on
account of his good looks. Having gone forth in search of some successor to their
deceased monarch, they find him sleeping under a tree, “the shadow of which never
moved from his body,” and they exclaim, “As he is extremely handsome, and is well
provided with signs, we will invest him with the sovereignty.” In the East-European
variants the fortunate youth is frequently chosen as king because his taper, when
he takes one to church, kindles of its own accord. One of the tasks which Mahaushadha
is called upon to execute by way of proving his cleverness is “to supply some rice
which had not been crushed with a pestle, and yet was not uncrushed, and which had
been cooked neither in the house nor out of the house, neither with fire nor yet without
fire,” and to send it “neither along the road nor yet away from the road, without
its being shone upon by the daylight, but yet not in the shade,” by a messenger who
should be “not riding, but also not on foot” (page 139). Similar tests frequently
appear in European folk-tales. Thus, in one of the Lithuanian Tales (Schleicher, No.
1), a gentleman promises to marry a village maiden if she can fulfil certain conditions,
saying, “If you come to me neither clothed nor bare, not riding nor driving nor walking,
not along the road, nor beside the road, nor on the footpath, in summer and likewise
in winter, then will I marry you.” The abduction of the mule which was watched by
five men (page 142), one of whom sat on its back while the others held its four legs,
is evidently a reminiscence of an ingenious theft commemorated in many such stories
as “The Master Thief” (Grimm, No. 192). But Mahaushadha’s contrivances for making
the dog talk and for keeping <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xlvii">[<a href="#pb.xlvii">xlvii</a>]</span>the sheep thin (page 175) are novel. The latter, as a plan of working on the body
through the eye, may be compared with Jacob’s use of the rods which he placed “in
the watering-troughs when the flocks came to drink” (Genesis xxx. 38).
</p>
<p>The “Clever Thief” (No. 4) is one of the numerous variants of the well-known story
which we generally associate with the treasure of Rhampsinitos.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1372src" href="#xd31e1372">38</a> As Professor Schiefner has pointed out some of its Western parallels (pp. 37 and
43), it is not necessary to do more here than to add a few references to those which
he has given. Professor Schiefner has himself written on the subject.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1378src" href="#xd31e1378">39</a> The most recent commentator is Professor G. Maspero, who has devoted to it four pages
of the Introduction to his collection of ancient Egyptian tales.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1384src" href="#xd31e1384">40</a> The name of Rhampsinitos, he says, is a Greek form of the Egyptian name Ram-sis-si-nit,
or Ramses the son of Nit. Two objections, he remarks, have been made to the supposition
that the story is of Egyptian origin. One is the nature of the masonry employed by
the builders of the treasury, which has been stated not to be in keeping with Egyptian
architectural practice. The other is the shaving of the beards of the drunken soldiers
who had been set to watch the corpse of the clever thief’s comrade. This has been
said to be an incident evidently not of Egyptian origin, seeing that in Egypt only
barbarians wore beards. But Professor Maspero impugns both objections. He shows that
some Egyptian temples did actually possess hiding-places resembling that described
in the story; and as regards the shaving, he points out that in the first place Egyptians
could wear beards, and did wear them when they felt inclined, and that in the second
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xlviii">[<a href="#pb.xlviii">xlviii</a>]</span>place the soldiers who guarded the corpse would belong “to a tribe of Lybian origin
of the name of Matiou,” and therefore be fully entitled, in their capacity of foreigners,
to wear their beards. A modern Greek variant of the story has been lately discovered
in Cyprus,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1392src" href="#xd31e1392">41</a> and Mr. Tawney has recently translated an Indian variant,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1402src" href="#xd31e1402">42</a> which offers a striking resemblance to the Gaelic tale of “The Shifty Lad.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1405src" href="#xd31e1405">43</a> The Tibetan tale, however, is more nearly akin to the Egyptian form of the story
than to that which it takes in this Indian variant.
</p>
<p>The story of Prince Sudhana (No. 5) has several points in common with Western folk-tales.
One of these is the capture by the hunter Phalaka of the celestial maiden, the Kinnarī
Manoharā, who becomes Sudhana’s bride. This is effected by means of a “fast-binding
chain” which the hunter throws around her when she is bathing in a lake. Her companions
fly away heavenward, leaving her a captive on earth. This incident will at once remind
the reader of the captures of “swan-maidens” and other supernatural nymphs, which
so frequently occur in popular romance. It is usually the swan’s feather-dress or
bird-husk on which the liberty of the captured maiden depends. While she is deprived
of it she must live on earth as a mortal’s wife. But if she can recover it, she becomes
a bird once more, and soars heavenward. Manoharā is captured by means of a magic chain.
But her power of flying through the air depends upon her possession of a jewel. So
long as she is without that, she remains a slave; when she recovers it, she becomes
free and flies aloft.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1413src" href="#xd31e1413">44</a> Sudhana’s visit to the palace of his supernatural wife’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xlix">[<a href="#pb.xlix">xlix</a>]</span>father, and the task which is set him of recognising her amid her ladies, bear a strong
resemblance to the adventures which befall the heroes of many tales current in Europe.
A mortal youth often obtains, and then for a time loses, a supernatural wife, generally
represented as the daughter of a malignant demon. He makes his way, like Sudhana,
to the demon’s abode. There tasks are set him, which he accomplishes by means of his
wife’s help. One of these is that he shall recognise her when surrounded by her numerous
sisters, each of whom is exactly like her in appearance and dress. He calls upon her
to step forth from among them; she does so, and the recognition takes place.
</p>
<p>As a specimen of an European variant of the tale may be taken the Russian story of
“The Water-King” (“Russian Folk-Tales,” No. 19). In it a prince steals the dress of
one of the water-king’s twelve daughters while they are bathing. Her sisters become
spoonbills and fly away, but she remains in his power till he restores her dress.
Then she also flies away in spoonbill form. When he arrives after a time at her father’s
palace, she aids him to accomplish the tasks which are set him. At last the water-king
says, “Choose yourself a bride from among my twelve daughters. They are all exactly
alike in face, in hair, and in dress. If you can pick out the same one three times
running, she shall be your wife; if you fail to do so, I shall have you put to death.”
The maiden whose dress he had stolen and restored enables him to succeed in this task
also. The recognition of Sudhana by his wife, brought about by means of a ring, is
an incident of which frequent use is made in folk-tales. When a demon’s daughter,
or a princess who has been enslaved by a demon, has enabled a hero to escape along
with her from that demon’s power, she often warns him that he will forget her if he,
on his return home, kisses his mother (as in “Two Kings’ Children,” Grimm, No. 113),
or does something else which he has been forbidden to do. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb.l">[<a href="#pb.l">l</a>]</span>always neglects the warning and forgets his wife. But eventually she manages to remind
him of her existence, usually by means of a ring. In the similar story of “The Mastermaid”
(“Tales from the Norse,” No. 11), the recognition is due to a golden apple and two
golden fowls which the hero and heroine had carried off from a giant’s palace. In
“The Battle of the Birds” (Campbell’s “West Highland Tales,” No. 2), the prince forgets
the giant’s daughter after being kissed by “an old greyhound,” but remembers her when
he hears a conversation between a golden pigeon and a silver pigeon which spring out
of a glass offered to his forgotten love. Similar parallels to this story will be
found in most of the large collections of European folk-tales.
</p>
<p>A curious feature in the story is the ablution to which Manoharā is subjected after
her stay among mortals (p. 71), in order that “the smell of humanity” may be “washed
off her.” In a similar story in the “Kathā Sarit Sāgara,<span class="corr" id="xd31e1424" title="Not in source">”</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1425src" href="#xd31e1425">45</a> a hero who has been deserted by his celestial spouse, Bhadrā, wanders long in search
of her. At length he reaches a mountain lake to which come “to draw water many beautiful
women with golden pitchers in their hands.” He asks them why they are drawing water,
and they reply, “A Vidyádharí of the name of Bhadrá is dwelling on this mountain;
this water is for her to bathe in.” Whereupon he slips into one of the pitchers the
jewelled ring which his wife had given him. And so it comes to pass that when “the
water of ablution” is poured over her, the ring falls into her lap. She recognises
it, and all goes well.
</p>
<p>The long history of “Prince Jīvaka, the King of Physicians” (No. 6), has little in
common with Western folk-lore. The cures he performs, by either opening the skull
and removing from the brain headache-producing centipedes, or else eliminating such
similar intruders by a less heroic operation, may, however, be likened to somewhat
similar <span class="pageNum" id="pb.li">[<a href="#pb.li">li</a>]</span>kinds of surgical treatment mentioned in European folk-tales. Thus in a modern Greek
story<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1432src" href="#xd31e1432">46</a> a girl is relieved from the presence of a number of snakes which had taken up their
abode within her by being suspended from a branch of a tree above a caldron of boiling
milk, the vapour arising from which induced the reptiles to come forth. There is an
English story also of a country clergy-man who could obtain no rest from headaches,
till at last he induced the village blacksmith to hit him on the head with his largest
hammer. The ecclesiastic’s skull cracked beneath the blow, and out came sufficient
swarms of earwigs to account for his complaint. But this story requires verification.
The cure effected at p. 103, to which no parallel is found in the variant of the legend
in Mr. Spence Hardy’s “Manual of Buddhism,” though the skull-opening incident occurs
in it (p. 242), resembles that brought about by Kīrtisenā in the case of King Vasudatta’s
headache in the Kathā Sarit Sāgara.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1438src" href="#xd31e1438">47</a> She learnt how to treat the malady from a Rākshasī, who gave the following instructions
as to how the king might be cured, unaware that a human being was listening:—“First
his head must be anointed by rubbing warm butter on it, and then it must be placed
for a long time in the heat of the sun, intensified by noonday. And a hollow cane-tube
must be inserted into the aperture of his ear, which must communicate with a hole
in a plate, and this plate must be placed above a pitcher of cool water. Accordingly
the centipedes will be annoyed by heat and perspiration, and will come out of his
head, and will enter that cane-tube from the aperture of the ear, and, desiring coolness,
will fall into the pitcher.” Kīrtisenā carried out these instructions, and the result
was that she “extracted from the head of that king, through the aperture of the ear,
one hundred and fifty centipedes.”
</p>
<p>The lovely maiden Āmrapālī, the Dryad-like nymph <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lii">[<a href="#pb.lii">lii</a>]</span>who emerges (p. 85) from the kadalī tree in the āmra grove, closely resembles the
tree-maidens who figure in some European popular tales. In the 21st of Hahn’s “<span lang="de">Griechische Märchen</span>,” the stem of a laurel opens and forth comes “a wondrously fair maiden.” In the sixth
story of Basile’s “Pentamerone,” a fairy comes forth in the same way from a date spray,
and in the second from a bilberry twig. The homes of the nymphs of this class are
as often flowers as trees. In a Russian story (Afanasief, vi., No. 66), the heroine
is transformed after death into a wondrous blossom. At midnight “the blossom begins
to tremble, then it falls from its stem to the ground, and turns into a lovely maiden.”
In the same way the heroine of the German story of “The Pink” (Grimm, No. 76) becomes
a flower at her lover’s wish; and many other similar instances might be quoted. All
such ideas as these appear to have been originally connected with the tree-worship
which formed so important a part of the religion of our remote ancestors, and on which
so excellent a work was written a few years ago by the late Wilhelm Mannhardt.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1448src" href="#xd31e1448">48</a>
</p>
<p>Of special interest, as dealing with this kind of worship, is the opening of the Buddhistic
legend of Mahākāśyapa and Bhadrā (No. 9). Tree-worship existed long before Buddhism
was heard of, and it has succeeded in maintaining its existence in many lands up to
the present day. There is no lack of stories relating to it; but it is not often that
we obtain so clear an insight into the ideas of tree-worshippers, or are favoured
with so detailed an account of the rites which they were wont to celebrate, as are
afforded by the description of the childless Brahman’s appeal to the Nyagrodha tree
(p. 187). It serves to illustrate the confusion existing in the minds of tree-worshippers
between the material tree and its spiritual tenant. The Brahman Nyagrodha, the tree’s
namesake, first caused the ground in its neighbourhood to be “sprinkled, cleansed,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.liii">[<a href="#pb.liii">liii</a>]</span>and adorned.” Then he set up flags and banners, and provided a profusion of perfumes,
flowers, and incense. Finally, “he prayed to the tree-haunting deity,” promising to
pay that divine being due honour if a son should be born to him, but threatening,
in case he should remain childless, to cut down the tree and split it into chips,
destined to be consumed with fire. In another passage of the Kah-gyur (vol. vi., p.
280) Professor Schiefner remarks in a note appended to this passage, “Bhagavant gives
directions that, in case it is absolutely necessary to fell a tree, the work-masters
of the Bhikshus shall draw a circle around it seven or eight days before felling it,
offer up perfumes, flowers, and oblations, recite <i>tantras</i> and utter spells, proclaim abhorrence of the path of the ten vices, and moreover
say, ‘Let the deity who inhabits this tree find another dwelling. With this tree shall
a religious or ecclesiastical work be accomplished.’ Seven or eight days after this
the tree may be felled. But if any change be perceptible, it must not be felled. If
none is perceptible, then it may be cut down.”
</p>
<p>One of the stories of the “Panchatantra” (the 8th of Book 5) may be compared with
the opening of No. 9, so far as tree-worship is concerned, and with the already quoted
(in illustration of No. 1) German story about a wife’s unreasonable wishes. A weaver,
who wanted timber for a new loom, was about to fell a tree, when the spirit which
resided in it protested against the operation, and promised, if the tree was spared,
to fulfil any wish the weaver might express. The weaver assented, but before specifying
his wish he went home and consulted his wife. She recommended him to ask for an additional
pair of hands and another head, for by their means he would be able to keep two looms
going instead of one. The weaver took his wife’s advice, and requested the tree-spirit
to render him two-headed and four-armed. “No sooner said than done. In an instant
he became equipped with a couple of heads and four arms, and returned home highly
delighted with <span class="pageNum" id="pb.liv">[<a href="#pb.liv">liv</a>]</span>his new acquisitions. No sooner, however, did the villagers see him, than, greatly
alarmed, they exclaimed ‘a goblin! a goblin!’ and between striking him with sticks
and pelting him with stones speedily put an end to his existence.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1464src" href="#xd31e1464">49</a>
</p>
<p>The greater part of No. 9, the account of the ascetic life led by Bhadrā and her husband,
belongs to a different world from that of folk-lore, but in the “<span lang="la">Acta Sanctorum</span>,” and in some popular legends derived from that source, parallels may be found equally
conducive to edification.
</p>
<p>In No. 10, also, we are taken away from the region of folk-tales, but this time into
that of such literary fictions as form a part of the “Thousand and One Nights.” It,
also, is not of a very edifying nature; but it is valuable as showing what utter nonsense
many of the corrupted Buddhistic legends contain, and illustrating the custom prevalent
among literary Buddhists (one in which they were perhaps surpassed by the Christian
compilers of such works as the “Gesta Romanorum”) of appending an unexceptionable
moral to a tale of an unsavoury nature. The rapidity with which the narrator, at the
close of the story of Utpalavarṇā, passes from the record of her dissoluteness to
the account of her conversion is somewhat startling. The same remark applies also
to the close of the history of Kṛiśā Gautamī (No. 11). That narrative is as little
edifying, for the most part, as the legend which precedes it. One of the tricks resorted
to in it, the lengthening at will, by means of some magical substance, of the nose
of an obnoxious individual, frequently figures in popular tales. In one of the stories
from Central Asia (Jülg, “<span lang="de">Mongolische Märchen</span>,” No. 14), the fairies elongate an intruder’s nose to such an extent that they are
able to tie seven knots in it. But they perform that operation by sheer force. In
European folk-tales the abnormal growth of the nose, or the sudden appearance of horns
or the like, is generally caused by the magical properties of some fruit or other
apparently harmless substance <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lv">[<a href="#pb.lv">lv</a>]</span>(Grimm, No. 122, iii., 204, Hahn, No. 44). In the present case, the means employed
for the lengthening of the nose is a piece of wood, and a piece of another kind of
wood reverses the operation. In the folk-tales the magical substance which produces
the wished-for result is generally discovered by accident. In the Tibetan legend its
discovery is due to its employer’s observation of a raven, which lengthened its beak
by rubbing it on a piece of wood when it wanted to get at a corpse otherwise out of
its reach, and afterwards reduced it to its normal proportions when it had finished
its meal. The magic lute which plays so important a part in the story of <span class="corr" id="xd31e1480" title="Source: Śusroṇī">Suśroṇī</span> (No. 12) is of course closely related to all the musical instruments of magic power
which both literature and folk-lore have rendered familiar, from the harp or lyre
of Orpheus or Amphion to the pipe of the Piper of Hameln, the dance-inspiring fiddle
of the German tales of “Roland” and “The Jew in Thorns” (Grimm, Nos. 56 and 110),
the magic flute which an angel gives to the strong fool of the modern Greek story
of Bakala (Hahn, No. 34), and a number of similar instruments capable of making trees
and rocks reel and men and women wildly skip. In these dance-compelling instruments
many mythologists recognise symbols of the wind.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1483src" href="#xd31e1483">50</a> One of the most interesting of the European folk-tales in which such instruments
occur is the Esthonian story of “Pikne’s Bagpipes,” of which a full account is given
by A. de Gubernatis in his “Zoological Mythology” (i. 159–161), taken from Dr. Löwe’s
excellent translation of Kreutzwald’s collection (<span class="corr" id="xd31e1491" title="Not in source">“</span><span lang="de">Ehstnische Märchen</span>,” No. 9). In it the thunder-god is robbed of his bagpipes (<i>toru-pil</i>, “<span lang="de">Röhreninstrument</span>”) by the devil, who hides it away in hell, keeping it in an iron chamber guarded
by seven locks. The consequence is <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lvi">[<a href="#pb.lvi">lvi</a>]</span>that the clouds no longer yield a drop of rain. The thunder-god, under the form of
a boy, obtains access to hell, and persuades the devil to let him play on the magic
bagpipes. Thereupon “the walls of hell quaked, and the devil and his associates fainted
away and fell to the ground as though dead.” Returning home, the thunder-god “blew
into his thunder-instrument till the rain-gates opened and gave the earth to drink.”
The termination of the history of <span class="corr" id="xd31e1503" title="Source: Śusroṇī">Suśroṇī</span> is closely akin to that with which all complete variants of the “Puss in Boots” story
should end. They ought always to conclude with the ingratitude of the hero or heroine
of the tale to the cat or fox or other animal which has made itself useful. The Marquis
de Carabas ought to have proved ungrateful to the Booted Cat, just as <span class="corr" id="xd31e1506" title="Source: Śusroṇī">Suśroṇī</span> neglected to give her benefactor, the jackal, the daily meat which she had promised
it. The asseverations of the king’s wives in this story, and those of the hero and
heroine of No. 18, may be compared with the similar affirmations of the heroine of
the 26th of M. Legrand’s “<span lang="fr">Contes Populaires Grecs</span>.” In it a king suffers from a strange malady, three branches having grown over his
heart. His disguised sister tells him her story, and adds, “If I tell the truth, O
my king, may one of the branches break which is over your heart!” By three such asseverations
she breaks all three branches.
</p>
<p>The story (No. 13) of the actor who dramatises the life of Buddha, and is punished
for his audacity in making fun of the Six Bhikshus, soars high above the region of
folk-lore. And there is but little in European popular fiction which can be likened
to the legend of “The Dumb Cripple” (No. 14), who pretended to be unable to speak
or walk, in order that he might not be made a king, reflecting that, “if he were to
be invested with sovereign power, this would not be a good thing, seeing that in consequence
of a sixty years’ reign which he had accomplished in a previous state of existence,
he had been born again in hell, and that he now ran the risk of going to hell <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lvii">[<a href="#pb.lvii">lvii</a>]</span>a second time.” The same remark holds good of the not very edifying history of <span class="corr" id="xd31e1516" title="Source: Rshyaśringa">Ṛshyaśringa</span> or Gazelle Horn (No. 15), the ascetic who, out of spite, prevents rain from falling
until his asceticism and his magic power collapse together.
</p>
<p>The story of Viśvaṇtara (No. 16), the princely Bodisat, who not only gives away all
his property and retires into the forest of penance, but even surrenders his two children
to a cruel slave-owner, and finally hands over his wife to a stranger who demands
her, has been already told by Mr. Spence Hardy in his “Manual of Buddhism” (pp. 116–124),
under the title of “The Wessantara Játaka;” but as it is one of the most touching
of the class of legends to which it belongs, having in it more of human interest than
such narratives generally contain, and as the Tibetan variant is the more poetic and
pathetic of the two renderings of the tale, Professor Schiefner has done good service
by translating it. Such acts of renunciation as the princely Bodisat accomplished
do not commend themselves to the Western mind. An Oriental story-teller can describe
a self-sacrificing monarch as cutting slices of flesh off his own arms and plunging
them into the fire in honour of a deity, and yet not be afraid of exciting anything
but a religious thrill among his audience. To European minds such a deed would probably
appear grotesque. And so the Eastern tales in praise of self-sacrifice do not seem
to have impressed the lay mind of Europe. On ecclesiastical literature they probably
exerted considerable influence. But folk-tales do not often deal with such heroic
operations as were performed by Prince Viśvaṇtara in cutting himself loose from all
worldly ties in order that nothing might prevent him from becoming the consummate
Buddha. The sorrows of Madrī, the princely ascetic’s wife, who is reduced by her husband’s
passion for giving everything away first to exile and poverty, then to bitter grief
on account of the loss of her dearly loved little children, and finally to slavery,
but who submits to all her husband’s commands, may be <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lviii">[<a href="#pb.lviii">lviii</a>]</span>compared with those of the patient Grisildes whose praises Chaucer has sung in “The
Clerke’s Tale.” The Clerk states in his prologue that the story was one which he “lerned
at Padowe of a worthy clerk,” whose name was “Fraunces Petrark, the laureat poete;”
Petrarch having freely translated it in the year 1373 from Boccaccio’s “Decamerone.”
This story, however, appears to have been current in Italy for some time before. In
folk-tales the similar sorrows of a wife who is condemned to a series of humiliations
by a harsh husband are often described; but the husband’s conduct is generally accounted
for by the fact that his wife had at first rejected him with contumely, and he had
made up his mind to retaliate. Patient Grissel’s husband had absolutely no excuse
to plead for his cruelty, nor can much be said in extenuation of that of such a husband
as the German “King Thrushbeard” (Grimm, No. 52), the Norwegian “Hacon Grizzlebeard”
(“Tales from the Norse,” No. 6), or the Italian “King of Fairland,” the husband of
the proud Cintiella (Basile’s “Pentamerone,” No. 40). The Russian variant of “Patient
Grissel’s Story” (Afanasief, v. No. 29) seems worthy of mention, as not being likely
to be familiar to Western Europe. A king marries a peasant’s daughter on condition
that she shall never find fault with anything he says or does. She makes him an excellent
wife, and never opposes his will, even when he takes her children from her, pretending
that they are to be put to death, in order that his neighbours might not laugh at
them as being sprung from a peasant mother; or when he sends her back to her father’s
hut, and then recalls her from it as a servant, and orders her to get ready the room
intended for his new bride. But the Russian story, as it stands alone (with the exception
of the opening), is probably an echo from abroad.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1523src" href="#xd31e1523">51</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.lix">[<a href="#pb.lix">lix</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Nidānakathā or “The Three Epochs” (translated in Mr. Rhys Davids’s “Buddhist
Birth-Stories,” p. 33), there is an account of the great generosity of Mangala Buddha.
“The story is, that when he was performing the duties of a Bodhisatta, being in an
existence corresponding to the Vessentara existence,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1532src" href="#xd31e1532">52</a> he dwelt with his wife and children on a mountain.” One day a demon named “Sharp-fang,”
hearing of his readiness to bestow gifts, “approached him in the guise of a Brahmin,
and asked the Bodhisatta for his two children. The Bodhisatta, exclaiming, “I give
my children to the Brahmin,” cheerfully and joyfully gave up both the children, thereby
causing the ocean-girt earth to quake. The demon, standing by the bench at the end
of the cloistered walk, while the Bodhisatta looked on, devoured the children like
a bunch of roots. Not a particle of sorrow arose in the Bodhisatta as he looked on
the demon, and saw his mouth as soon as he opened it disgorging streams of blood like
flames of fire; nay, a great joy and satisfaction welled within him as he thought,
‘My gift was well given,’ and he put up the prayer, ‘By the merit of this deed may
rays of light one day issue from me in this very way.’ In consequence of this prayer
of his it was that the rays emitted from his body when he became Buddha filled so
vast a sphere.” Another strange Indian story about self-sacrifice is that of the Dānava
or Titan Namuchi,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1536src" href="#xd31e1536">53</a> who “did not refuse to give anything to anybody that asked, even if he were his enemy.”
Having practised asceticism for ten thousand years “as a drinker of smoke,” he was
allowed by Brahmā to become, like Balder, proof against all the ordinary forces of
nature. After that he frequently made war against Indra, and often overcame him. When
the gods and the Asuras churned the ocean of milk with the mountain Mandara, Namuchi
received, as his share in the products <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lx">[<a href="#pb.lx">lx</a>]</span>of the churning, a horse which had the power of restoring to life, by a sniff, any
Asura whom the gods had killed. This gave him great power. At length Indra went to
Namuchi and asked for that horse as a gift. Namuchi gave it, and Indra, “as he could
not be slain by any other weapon, killed him with foam of the Ganges, in which he
had placed a thunderbolt.” However, he was born again as “an Asura composed all of
jewels,” and he conquered Indra a hundred times. “Then the gods took counsel together,
and came to him, and said to him, ‘By all means give us your body for a human sacrifice.’
When he heard that, he gave them his own body, although they were his enemies: noble
men do not turn their backs on a suppliant, but bestow on him even their lives.”
</p>
<p>The story of a charitable monarch, whose uprightness and generosity are put to a severe
test by a deity, occurs as a folk-tale in Miss Maive Stokes’s “Indian Fairy Tales”
(No. 13). It properly belongs to literature, in which it has assumed various forms,
one of which has been made known to English readers by the late Sir Mutu Coomāra Swāmy
in his “Arichandra, or the Martyr of Truth; a Drama translated from the Tamil.” The
story as told by an Indian ayah takes this form. There was a king named Harchand,
who “used to pray a great deal to God, and God was very fond of him,” but thought
fit to test his goodness. So one day, when he had promised an ascetic “two pounds
and a half of gold,” all his wealth was turned into charcoal. In order to keep his
word, Harchand was obliged to sell his wife and child for a pound and a half of gold,
and then he sold himself for the other pound. Having become the property of “a Dom,
that is, a man of a very low caste, who kept a tank into which it was his business
to throw the bodies of those who died,” he was charged with the care of the tank,
and ordered to take a rupee in payment for each adult corpse, eight annas for a dead
child, or a piece of cloth, in case the bearers of the body had no money. One day
his wife arrived, bearing <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lxi">[<a href="#pb.lxi">lxi</a>]</span>the corpse of his son, who had died. She had no money, but she said to herself, “I
know that man is my husband, so he will not take any money for throwing his child
into the water.” But he was so honest, in the interests of his master, that he insisted
upon a fee, which had to be paid at the expense of his wife’s single covering. Eventually
all went well, the dead boy was restored to life, and when the reunited royal family
returned home, “the garden was in splendid beauty; the charcoal was turned back into
gold, and silver, and jewels; the servants were in waiting as usual, and they went
into the palace and lived happily for evermore.”
</p>
<p>The principal theme of “The Fulfilled Prophecy” (No. 17) is one that often occurs
in popular tales, many of which are devoted to proving how impossible it is for a
man, whatever crimes he may commit, to escape from his destiny. The “Two Brothers”
(No. 18) is one of the great cycle of moral tales in which goodness is contrasted
with badness, to the temporary advantage but eventual discomfiture of the latter.
The blinding of the good brother by the bad is an incident suggestive of the opening
of the well-known folk-tales of “True and Untrue” (“Tales from the Norse,” No. 1),
the “Two Wanderers” (Grimm, No. 107), and a great number of similar stories, to many
of which references are given in vol. iii. p. 189, of Grimm’s collection.
</p>
<p>Stories about ungrateful wives are popular in Asia. In No. 21, “How a woman requites
love,” a husband twice saves his wife’s life, once by rescuing her from his brothers,
who proposed to feed upon her when destitute of other food in a desert, and again
by supplying her with food and drink, much to his own inconvenience, when she was
faint from hunger and thirst. “He sliced some flesh off his thighs,” says the narrator,
“and gave it to her to eat; and then he opened the veins of both his arms and gave
her the blood to drink.” In spite of which, she conspired against him with a handless
and footless cripple. <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lxii">[<a href="#pb.lxii">lxii</a>]</span>In one of the Indian variants of the story (“Panchatantra,” iv. 5), the husband’s
self-sacrifice takes a more poetic form. In the midst of a forest a wife suffered
intensely from thirst. Her husband went to seek water. When he came back with some
his wife was dead. A voice was heard saying that if he would give up half of his own
life hers would be renewed. He immediately pronounced a formula by which he surrendered
half of his life, and his wife was thereby resuscitated. Soon afterwards, being in
a garden one day during the absence of her husband, she heard a cripple singing so
beautifully that she fell in love with him at once. So she took an early opportunity
of pushing her husband into a well. After which she led a wandering life, carrying
about the cripple in a basket on her head. But her husband, who had not been killed
by his fall, escaped from the well, and at length confronted her one day in the presence
of a king, and demanded back the half of his life which he had given her. She uttered
formal words of surrender and fell dead. The Indian variant of the story in the Daśakumāracharita
is closely akin to the Tibetan, the husband assuaging his wife’s hunger and thirst
by means of his own flesh and blood, and being rewarded by being pushed into a well
by his wife, who had fallen in love with a cripple whose hands, feet, nose, and ears
had been cut off by robbers.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1550src" href="#xd31e1550">54</a> This story appears to be the original of a singular Mongol tale (Jülg’s “<span lang="de">Mongolische Märchen</span>,” p. 105). A man and his wife were walking along near a cliff, when they heard so
lovely a voice resounding that the woman said to herself, “I should like to belong
to the man who possesses so charming a voice,” and she proceeded to push her husband
into a well. Then she set off in search of the possessor of the voice. When she found
him, he turned out to be a loathsome invalid, whose groans <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lxiii">[<a href="#pb.lxiii">lxiii</a>]</span>had been rendered melodious by the echoing cliff. Full of remorse, she tried to make
up for the murder of her husband by carrying away the invalid, under whose disagreeable
weight she pined away and eventually died (Benfey, “Panchatantra,” i. pp. 436–444).
The form assumed by the story in the Kathā Sarit Sāgara<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1563src" href="#xd31e1563">55</a> is almost identical with that in the Kah-gyur. The end, however, is more savage in
the Indian than in the Tibetan variant. After the ungratefulness of the wife had been
exposed, the king’s ministers “cut off her nose and ears and branded her, and banished
her from the country with the maimed man. And in this matter Fate showed a becoming
combination, for it united a woman without nose and ears with a man without hands
and feet.” In the “Three Snake Leaves” (Grimm, No. 16), a wife who has been resuscitated
after her death by her husband conspires against him with a ship-captain and has him
flung into the sea. He is saved, however, and she and her accomplice are ultimately
discovered and sentenced to be drowned.
</p>
<p>The story of “The Grateful Animals and the Ungrateful Man” (No. 26) is one that is
very widely spread throughout Asia, and has made its way into many parts of Europe.
The merits of the lower animals were, in Eastern stories, frequently contrasted with
the demerits of man, so far at least as gratitude is concerned, many centuries before
such ideas as have in modern times led to the formation of societies for the protection
of animals had exercised any influence over European thought. In the present instance
a hunter, who draws out of a pit a lion, a snake, a mouse, a falcon, and a man, is
rewarded by the two beasts, the bird, and the reptile, and by their aid is enabled
to escape from prison, after having been thrown into it in consequence of the machinations
of the man he had saved. In the “Panchatantra” (Appendix to Book i. story 2) a Brahman
rescues a tiger, a monkey, a snake, and a man, with similar results. From the work
of which <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lxiv">[<a href="#pb.lxiv">lxiv</a>]</span>the “Panchatantra” is the Sanskrit representative, the story made its way, about 750
<span class="asc">A.D.</span>, into the Syriac “Kalilag and Damnag,” and the Arabic “Kalilah and Dimnah,” and thence,
about 1080 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, into Symeon Seth’s Greek translation from the Arabic, and the Latin translation
(through the Hebrew) by Joannes of Capua in the second half of the thirteenth century,
and so into the Spanish, German, French, Italian, and English translations of different
versions of the Arabic work.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1576src" href="#xd31e1576">56</a> It occurs also in other works of Buddhistic origin. In a story from the Rasavāhinī,
quoted by Spiegel in his “Anecdota Pālica,” an inhabitant of Benares rescues from
a hole a dog, a snake, and a man. The dog and the snake are grateful, and by their
means their rescuer is enabled to escape the impalement to which he had been condemned
in consequence of the malice of the ungrateful man he had rescued along with them.
There can be little doubt that it was from Indian, and probably Buddhistic, sources
that such grateful animals made their way into European folk-tales—as the ants, fish,
and birds of the “White Snake” (Grimm, No. 17); the lions, bears, wolves, foxes, and
hares of “The Two Brothers” (No. 60); the ants, ducks, and bees of “The Queen Bee”
(No. 62); the horse, ducks, stork, and bees of “The Two Wanderers” (No. 107); and
the bear, mouse, and monkey of “The Faithful Beasts” (Grimm, 104 of first edition,
afterwards omitted); not to speak of the numberless counterparts of these grateful
creatures in the folk-tales of every European land.
</p>
<p>Of the rest of the stories, the greater part belong to the class of animal fables.
Many of them are old acquaintances under a new guise. “The Ungrateful Lion” (No. 27),
for instance, which tells how a woodpecker extracted a bone from a lion’s throat,
and was supposed by the lion to be sufficiently paid for his trouble by its escape
from his jaws, closely resembles the fable of the wolf which paid <span class="pageNum" id="pb.lxv">[<a href="#pb.lxv">lxv</a>]</span>in similar coin its long-billed benefactor. “The Wolf and the Sheep” (No. 29) is the
familiar fable of “The Wolf and the Lamb,” but the final argument of the wolf is different.
The story of the ass which insists upon singing at the wrong time, and so is caught
trespassing, and is punished (No. 32), has made its mark in European literature. The
jackal which acts as arbiter between the two otters (No. 34), and takes as its share
the main part of the fish they catch, leaving only the head and tail for them, closely
resembles the well-known legal eater of the disputed oyster and presenter of the oyster-shells
to the two claimants who had referred their dispute to his decision. The moral of
the tale in which the lion is saved by the jackal (No. 35) is the same as that of
the fable of the netted lion which the mouse rescued by gnawing its bonds. The blue-stained
jackal (No. 36) is one of the disguised animals about which many fables are current
in the West, such as the ass in the lion’s hide, or the cat which fell into a shoemaker’s
tub, and afterwards played the part of a nun. And the monkeys which see the reflection
of the moon in a well, and think that it has fallen out of the sky into the water,
and form themselves into a chain whereby to draw it out (No. 45), are closely related
to the foolish persons of the Wise Men of Gotham class, to whom various similar follies
are attributed in many lands.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In olden days, when the life of man was of unlimited duration, lived King Utposhadha.
On the crown of his head grew a very soft tumour, somewhat resembling a cushion of
cotton or wool, without doing him any harm. When it had become quite ripe and had
broken, there came forth from it a boy, shapely and handsome and gracious, perfect
in every limb and joint, with a skin the colour of gold, a head like a canopy, long
arms, a broad forehead, interlacing eyebrows, and a body provided with the thirty-two
signs of a Mahāpurusha.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1603src" href="#xd31e1603">2</a> Immediately after his birth he was taken into the apartments of the women; and when
King Utposhadha’s eighty thousand wives saw him, milk began to flow from their breasts,
and each of the women cried out, “Let him suck me! let him suck me!”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1606src" href="#xd31e1606">3</a> Wherefore he received the name of Māndhātar.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1610src" href="#xd31e1610">4</a> Some of them thought that, as he came into life out of the crown of a head, he ought
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>receive the name of Mūrdhaja (crown-born); consequently the name Māndhātar is known
to some, and that of Mūrdhaja to others.
</p>
<p>The young Māndhātar passed through a space of six Śakra-evanescences<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1629src" href="#xd31e1629">5</a> during his boyhood, and an equal length of time after he was appointed crown prince.
Once, while Prince Māndhātar was absent on a journey, King Utposhadha fell ill. As
he became still worse, although he was treated with medicines from roots, stems, leaves,
blossoms, and fruits, he ordered the ministers to invest the prince with sovereign
power. In accordance with the king’s orders, they sent word to the prince that King
Utposhadha was ill, and had determined to summon him in order to invest him with sovereignty;
it was meet, therefore, that he should come quickly. Soon after the messenger had
set out King Utposhadha died. Thereupon the ministers sent another messenger with
the tidings that the prince’s father was dead, and that he ought now to come in order
to assume the regal power. But Prince Māndhātar was of opinion that, as his father
was dead, there could be no use in his going, and he remained where he was. The ministers
again assembled and sent a minister as messenger. When he came to the prince and invited
him to assume the sovereign power, Māndhātar said, “If in accordance with the law
I acquire the power, the investiture therein ought to take place here.”
</p>
<p>The ministers sent to say, “O king, as there are many things which are needed for
a regal investiture, such as a jewel-strewing,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1634src" href="#xd31e1634">6</a> a throne, a canopy, a fillet, and armlets, and as the consecration must take place
in the palace, therefore it is necessary that the prince should come here.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>He replied, “If the power comes to me in accordance with the law, then will all these
things come here.”
</p>
<p>The Yaksha Divaukasa, who ran in front of Prince Māndhātar, brought the throne and
the jewel-strewing, the inmates of the palace brought the canopy, the fillet, and
the armlets. As the inmates of the palace came themselves, the place received the
name of Sāketa.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1643src" href="#xd31e1643">7</a> When after this the ministers, the commander-in-chief, and the town and country people
had drawn nigh unto the prince for the consecration, they said, “O king, be pleased
to receive the consecration.”
</p>
<p>He replied, “Shall men, forsooth, lay the fillet on me? If I acquire the power according
to law, the fillet shall be laid on me by demons.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1650src" href="#xd31e1650">8</a>
</p>
<p>Thereupon the fillet was laid upon him by demons. Moreover the seven treasures were
revealed,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1656src" href="#xd31e1656">9</a> namely, the treasure of the wheel, the treasure of the elephant, the treasure of
the horse, the treasure of the gem, the treasure of the wife, the treasure of the
householder, and, as the seventh, the treasure of the minister. Also there fell to
his share fully a thousand sons, heroic, sturdy, endowed with the beauty of splendid
bodies, victorious over hosts of foes.
</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of Vaiśālī there was a dense forest of a delightful aspect, in
which five hundred hermits endowed with the five kinds of insight<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1661src" href="#xd31e1661">10</a> had abandoned themselves to contemplation; and in this dense forest there dwelt also
a great number of cranes. Now, as noise is a hindrance to contemplation, and the cranes
made a noise as they flew, one of these Rishis <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>became angry, and uttered a curse to the effect that the cranes’ wings should be enfeebled.
So, in consequence of the cranes having irritated the Rishis, their wings became feeble,
and they took to going about, walking on their feet. The king, as he went afield,
saw the cranes walking about in this way, and asked the ministers why the cranes went
afoot. The ministers replied, “O king, as noise is a hindrance to contemplation, the
Rishis in their wrath have cursed the cranes. On that account, in consequence of the
anger of the Rishis, the cranes’ wings have grown weak.”
</p>
<p>The king said, “Can they be Rishis who are so pitiless towards living creatures? Go
to them, sirs, and tell them in my name that they shall not remain in my realm.”
</p>
<p>The ministers executed his commands. The Rishis reflected that the king had power
over the four quarters of the world, and they determined to betake themselves to the
slopes of Sumeru. So they went away and settled there.
</p>
<p>As King Māndhātar’s subjects were thinkers, scanners, and testers, and as in the course
of thinking, scanning, and testing they took to cultivating various arts and industries,
they obtained the designation of the Wise. Now they occupied themselves with field-labour.
When the king, as he went afield one day, saw them engaged in field-labour, he asked
the ministers what those men were doing. The ministers replied, “O king, in order
that they may obtain refreshment, they produce corn and so forth.” The king said,
“What! do men practise husbandry in my realm? Let the deity send down a rain of seven-and-twenty
kinds of seed.” No sooner had King Māndhātar conceived this idea than the deity sent
down a rain of twenty-seven kinds of seed. When the king asked the people of his realm
to whose merits this occurrence was due, they replied, “To the king’s merits, as well
as also to our own.”
</p>
<p>Later on, men took to tilling cotton-fields. When <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>King Māndhātar saw this as he went afield, he asked the ministers what those men were
doing. The ministers replied, “O king, they are tilling cotton-fields.” The king asked
what was the use of that. They answered that it was done for the purpose of producing
clothes. Then said the king, “What! shall the men of my country till cotton-fields?
Let the deity send down a rain of cotton.” No sooner had King Māndhātar conceived
this idea than the deity let a rain of cotton fall. When the king asked the people
of his realm to whose merits this occurrence was due, they replied, “To the king’s
merits, as well as also to our own.”
</p>
<p>Afterwards these men began to spin cotton, and the king asked what they were doing.
The ministers replied, “O king, they are spinning cotton in order to procure thread.”
The king said, “What! are the people in my realm spinning thread? Let the deity send
down a rain of cotton thread.” No sooner had King Māndhātar conceived this idea than
the deity sent down a rain of cotton thread. The king asked to whose merits this occurrence
was due. The answer was, “To the king’s merits, as well as also to our own.”
</p>
<p>After this, when they gradually began to weave cotton, the king asked what they were
doing. The answer was, “O king, they are weaving cotton in order to obtain raiment.”
The king said to himself, “What! shall the men of my realm weave cotton? Let the deity
send down a rain of raiment.” No sooner had King Māndhātar conceived this idea than
the deity sent down a rain of raiment. The king asked to whose merits this occurrence
was due. The answer was, “To the king’s merits, as well as also to our own.”
</p>
<p>The king thought, “These men are ignorant of the power of my merits. I possess Jambudvīpa,
the vast, rich, prosperous, fruitful realm, abounding in men and living creatures.
I possess the seven treasures, the treasures of the wheel, of the elephant, of the
horse, of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>gem, of the wife, of the householder, and, seventhly, of the minister. I possess a
complete thousand of bold, heroic sons, endowed with the beauty of splendid limbs,
entirely victorious over opponents. Now, then, let a rain of precious stones fall
within my palace, but not so much as a single piece of money outside.”
</p>
<p>Scarcely had this idea occurred to King Māndhātar when there began to fall within
his palace a rain of precious stones which lasted for seven days, while outside not
so much as a single piece of money fell. So King Māndhātar, like a being who has acquired
great power and supernatural force by means of virtue and merit, enjoyed the fruits
of his merits. The king asked to whose merits this was due. The reply was, “To the
merits of the king.” Then the king said, “Honoured sirs, ye have been in the wrong.
If ye had said that all these things took place on account of the merits of the king,
I should have caused a rain of precious stones to fall over the whole of Jambudvīpa,
and each of you who wanted gems would have had as many as he wished.”
</p>
<p>During this inauguration of King Māndhātar’s rule six Śakra-evanescences passed away.
Then King Māndhātar asked his runner, the Yaksha Divaukasa, “Is there not some part
of the world as yet unsubdued by me which I could subdue?”
</p>
<p>Divaukasa replied, “O king, there is the dvīpa named Pūrvavideha, which is vast, rich,
prosperous, fruitful, and replete with many men and living creatures. Thither might
the king go and rule.”
</p>
<p>Then King Māndhātar reflected that he was in possession of the rich and so forth Jambudvīpa,
that he possessed the seven treasures, that of the wheel and so forth, that he had
a full thousand of heroic sons, that a rain of precious stones had fallen inside his
palace for seven whole days, and that he now heard that there existed a part of the
world called Pūrvavideha; so he determined that he would go thither and rule over
it also. Scarcely <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>had the king entertained this idea when, surrounded by his thousand sons, and accompanied
by an army eighteen koṭi<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1688src" href="#xd31e1688">11</a> strong, he rose heavenward and betook himself to Pūrvavidehadvīpa. There, like a
being who has acquired great power and supernatural force by means of virtue and merit,
he ruled, enjoying the fruits of his merits, for many years, many hundreds, many thousands,
many hundreds of thousands of years. While he was ruling over Pūrvavidehadvīpa, six
Śakra-evanescences passed away.
</p>
<p>Afterwards King Māndhātar asked the Yaksha Divaukasa whether there existed any other
dvīpas not as yet rendered subject to him. Divaukasa replied that there still remained
a dvīpa called Aparagodānīya, vast, rich, prosperous, fruitful, replete with many
men and living creatures, and that the king should go thither and reign therein. Then
King Māndhātar reflected that he possessed the rich and so forth Jambudvīpa, that
a rain of precious stones had fallen within his palace for the space of seven days,
that he had come to Pūrvavidehadvīpa, and ruled there during many years, many hundreds,
many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years, and that as he now heard that
there existed another dvīpa, called Aparagodānīya, he would go there also and rule
over it too. Scarcely had King Māndhātar entertained this idea when he rose heavenward,
surrounded by his thousand sons, accompanied by a host eighteen koṭi strong. Having
reached Aparagodānīya, he tarried therein; and like a being who has acquired great
power and supernatural force by means of virtue and merit, enjoying the fruits of
his deserts, he ruled in Aparagodānīya for many years, many hundreds, many thousands,
many hundreds of thousands of years. While he was ruling in Aparagodānīya, six Śakra-evanescences
passed away.
</p>
<p>Afterwards King Māndhātar asked the Yaksha Divaukasa whether there remained any other
dvīpa not yet subjected to him. Divaukasa replied that there was <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>another dvīpa called Uttarakuru, vast, rich, prosperous, fruitful, replete with many
men and living creatures, the inhabitants of which were still unsubdued and independent,
and that he ought to go there and rule over his hosts. Thereupon King Māndhātar reflected
that he possessed the vast, rich, and so forth Jambudvīpa, that a rain of precious
stones had fallen within his palace for the space of seven days, that he had ruled
in Pūrvavidehadvīpa for many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of
thousands of years, and that he had done likewise in Aparagodānīya, and that he now
heard that there also existed a dvīpa called Uttarakuru, vast, rich, prosperous, fruitful,
replete with many men and living creatures, the inhabitants of which region were as
yet unsubdued and independent, and that it was meet for him to go there and rule his
hosts. Scarcely had King Māndhātar entertained this idea when he rose heavenwards,
surrounded by his thousand sons, accompanied by an army eighteen koṭi strong, his
seven treasures having been sent on in front. On one side of Sumeru he saw several
white spots. Having remarked them, he asked the Yaksha Divaukasa what those white
spots were. “O king,” replied the Yaksha, “what you see is the rice grown without
ploughing or sowing by the inhabitants of Uttarakuru. As they enjoy this rice without
having ploughed or sown, so will you, O king, when you have arrived there, enjoy this
rice which grows without ploughing or sowing.” King Māndhātar spoke about this to
his ministers, saying, “Have ye, O chieftains, seen the white spots?”
</p>
<p>“Yes!”
</p>
<p>“O chieftains, they are formed by the rice which the inhabitants of Uttarakuru obtain
without ploughing or sowing. As the inhabitants of Uttarakuru enjoy this rice which
grows without ploughing or sowing, so will ye also enjoy it when ye have arrived there.”
</p>
<p>King Māndhātar afterwards saw from afar some <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>garland-like trees of various colours planted on one side of Sumeru. Having remarked
them, he asked the Yaksha Divaukasa what were these garland-like trees of various
colours. “O king, these are the wishing-trees of the inhabitants of Uttarakuru. The
inhabitants of Uttarakuru clothe themselves with garments from the wishing-trees.”
</p>
<p>When King Māndhātar heard this, he said to his ministers, “O chieftains, have you
seen the garland-like trees of various colours planted over there?”
</p>
<p>“Yes!”
</p>
<p>“O chieftains, those are the wishing-trees that bear the garments with which the inhabitants
of Uttarakuru clothe themselves. Ye also, when ye have arrived there, will clothe
yourselves with garments from off the wishing-trees.”
</p>
<p>King Māndhātar reached Uttarakuru, and there, enjoying the fruits of his deserts,
like a being who has acquired great power and supernatural force through his virtue
and merit, he ruled over his hosts for many years, many hundreds, many thousands,
many hundreds of thousands of years. While he ruled over his hosts there, six Śakra-evanescences
passed away.
</p>
<p>Later on King Māndhātar asked the Yaksha Divaukasa whether there still remained anywhere
a dvīpa as yet unsubdued. Divaukasa said, “No, there is none. However, there are the
thirty-tree gods, who, long-lived, endowed with beauty, and replete with bliss, perpetually
abide in the lofty Vimāna palace. Be pleased, O king, to go thither in order to look
upon the thirty-three gods.” Then King Māndhātar reflected that he possessed the vast,
rich, prosperous, fruitful, and replete with many men and living beings Jambudvīpa,
and that he possessed the seven treasures of the wheel and so forth, and that he had
a full thousand of heroic sons, and that a rain of precious stones had fallen within
his palace for the space of seven days, and that he had gone to Pūrvavidehadvīpa <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>and had ruled there for many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of
thousands of years; and that he had gone on to Aparagodānīyadvīpa, and had there ruled
for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years;
and that he had moved forward to Uttarakurudvīpa, and there also had ruled over his
hosts for many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of
years; and that inasmuch as there were thirty-three gods, long-lived, endowed with
beauty, and replete with bliss, perpetually abiding in the lofty Vimāna palace, therefore
he would make his way thither in order to visit the thirty-three gods. Scarcely had
this idea occurred to King Māndhātar when he arose, surrounded by his thousand sons,
accompanied by an army eighteen koṭi strong, and proceeded heavenwards, sending his
seven jewels on in front.
</p>
<p>Sumeru, the monarch of mountains, is surrounded by seven mountains of gold. King Māndhātar
tarried on Mount Nemindhara, and while he ruled over his hosts on Mount Nemindhara
six Śakra-evanescences passed away. Thence he betook himself to the golden mountain
Aśvakarṇa. While he ruled over his hosts there six Śakra-evanescences passed away.
From Mount Aśvakarṇa he went to the golden mountain Sudarśana, and while he ruled
over his hosts there six Śakra-evanescences passed away. From Mount Sudarśana he went
to the golden mountain Khadiraka, and while he ruled over his hosts there six Śakra-evanescences
passed away. From Mount Khadiraka he went to the golden mountain Iśādhāra, and while
he ruled over his hosts there six Śakra-evanescences passed away. From Mount Iśādhāra
he went to the golden mountain Yugandhara, and while he ruled over his hosts there
six Śakra-evanescences passed away.
</p>
<p>When he left Mount Yugandhara, taking his course heavenwards, the five hundred Rishis,
who now dwelt on <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>one of the slopes of Sumeru, saw him coming, and they said, “Honoured sirs, here comes
the worst of kings.” The Rishi Durmukha poured water into the palms of his hands,
and flung it towards the host in order to stop it. Then the treasure of the minister,
which went in front of the host, said to the Rishis, “O Brahmans, cease to be angry.
This is one who is everywhere victorious. This is King Māndhātar. It is not a case
of cranes.” Now when King Māndhātar came up to that spot, he asked who had stopped
the army. The treasure of the minister replied that the Rishis had done so. The king
asked what those Rishis delighted in. The minister replied, “In their matted hair.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1717src" href="#xd31e1717">12</a> The king said, “Then let it fall. And as for themselves, let them go on in front
of me.” Thereupon their matted hair fell, and they themselves began to move on in
front of him, their hands grasping bows and arrows. Then the treasure of the wife
said to the king, “O king, these Rishis are practising austerities; you ought to let
them go free.” So the king let them go free; and when they had again betaken themselves
to their works of penance they became possessed of the five kinds of insight.
</p>
<p>But King Māndhātar ascended higher together with his hosts. Now Sumeru, the monarch
of mountains, plunged 80,000 yojanas<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1725src" href="#xd31e1725">13</a> deep into the golden soil and soared aloft 80,000 yojanas above the waters, so its
height was 160,000 yojanas. Each side also measured 80,000 yojanas, so that its circumference
was 360,000 yojanas. Formed of four kinds of jewels, it was beautiful and splendid
to look upon. On its summit dwelt the thirty-three gods. The five defences of the
thirty-three gods were the water-inhabiting Nāgas, the dish-bearing Yakshas, the garland-wearing
and the ever-elevated gods, and the four Mahārājas. The water-inhabiting Nāgas <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>stopped King Māndhātar’s host. When King Māndhātar came up he asked who had stopped
his host. The answer was, “O king, the water-inhabiting Nāgas have stopped it.” The
king said, “Shall animals wage war with me? These water-inhabiting Nāgas shall themselves
be my advanced guard.” Then the Nāgas marched along in front of King Māndhātar.
</p>
<p>As the Nāgas marched along in front of the king they reached the abode of the dish-bearing
gods, who said, “Honoured sirs, wherefore are ye on the move?” The Nāgas replied,
“The king of men is coming here.” Then the Nāgas and the dish-bearing gods turned
round and stopped the host. When King Māndhātar came up he asked who had stopped his
host. The answer was, “O king, these dish-bearing gods have stopped it.” King Māndhātar
said, “Let the dish-bearing gods themselves march in front of me.” Thereupon they
began to move onwards.
</p>
<p>They and the Nāgas reached the abode of the garland-wearing gods, who asked them why
they were on the move. They replied, “The king of men is coming here.” Thereupon these
gods and the Nāgas turned round and tried to stop the host. When the king came up
he asked who had stopped his army. The answer was, “O king, the garland-wearing gods
have stopped it.” The king said, “Let these garland-wearing gods themselves march
in front of me.” Thereupon they began to move along in front.
</p>
<p>As they proceeded they reached the abode of the ever-elevated gods,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1734src" href="#xd31e1734">14</a> who asked why they were on the move. <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>They replied, “The king of men is coming here.” Thereupon they turned round and stopped
the host. When the king came up he asked who had stopped the host. He was told that
the ever-elevated gods had stopped it. The king said, “Let the ever-elevated gods
march in front of me.” Thereupon they began to move onwards.
</p>
<p>When they reached the abode of the four Mahārājas, and were asked by them why they
were on the move, they said, “The king of men is coming here.” The gods of the region
of the four Mahārājas reflected that this must be a being endowed with great force
of merit, and that they must not venture to impede him. Thereupon they informed the
gods of the region of the thirty-three gods that the king of men was coming. The gods
of the region of the thirty-three gods reflected that this must be a being endowed
with great force of merit, and that, therefore, they ought not to repel him, but should
receive him with honour. So the thirty-three gods received him with honour.
</p>
<p>When king Māndhātar had ascended to the summit of Sumeru he saw a blue forest tract
rising aloft like a tower of cloud, and he asked the Yaksha Divaukasa what it was.
The Yaksha replied, “Those are the divine trees Pārijātaka and Kovidāra, under which
the thirty-three gods, captivated and enchained by the five divine pleasures of sense,
do sport, rejoice, and enjoy themselves throughout the four summer months. You also,
O king, when you have arrived there, captivated by the five divine pleasures of sense,
will sport, rejoice, and enjoy yourself.” When King Māndhātar heard this, he asked
his ministers if they had seen those tall blue trees which rose aloft like a tower
of cloud, and when they replied that they had seen them, he said, “O chieftains, those
trees are Pārijātaka and Kovidāra, the trees of the thirty-three gods, under which
the thirty-three gods, captivated by the five divine pleasures of sense, do sport,
rejoice, and enjoy themselves during the four summer <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>months. Ye also, O chieftains, on arriving there, captivated by the five pleasures
of sense, shall sport, rejoice, and enjoy yourselves.”
</p>
<p>Afterwards King Māndhātar perceived on the summit of Sumeru something white, which
rose aloft like an accumulated mass of cloud, and he asked the Yaksha Divaukasa what
it was. “O king,” was the reply, “that is the meeting-place of the thirty-three gods,
and it is named Sudharmā. There the thirty-three gods and the four Mahārājas meet
together, and there they view, scan, and test the affairs of gods and men. Into that
place you also, O king, will enter.” On hearing this, King Māndhātar asked his ministers
if they had seen the white mass which rose aloft like an accumulation of clouds, and
when they had answered affirmatively, he said, “O chieftains, that is the meeting-place
of the thirty-three gods and the four Mahārājas, Sudharmā by name. There the thirty-three
gods and the four Mahārājas meet together, and view, scan, and test the affairs of
gods and men. Thither, O chieftains, will ye also make your way.”
</p>
<p>Sudarśana, the city of the thirty-three gods, was 2500 yojanas in length and as many
in breadth, and its circumference was 10,000 yojanas. It was surrounded by seven rows
of golden walls, which were two and a half yojanas high. These walls had quadruple
cornices of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal, and windows were set in them above and
below. The space lying inside the city of Sudarśana was fair to see, pleasant, extensive,
and copiously variegated with a hundred colours, and the ground was soft, extremely
soft, like a cushion of cotton or wool, yielding to the pressure of the foot, rising
again when the foot was lifted, and covered knee-deep with divine mandārava [or coral-tree]
flowers; when a wind arose, the faded blossoms were swept away and a rain of fresh
flowers descended. The city of Sudarśana had 999 gates, and at each gate were stationed
500 Yakshas arrayed in blue robes and coats of mail, and armed with bows and arrows,
to serve as a guard <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>and defence for the thirty-three gods, and also as an ornament. The market-place of
Sudarśana, which was 2500 yojanas long and twelve broad, was fair to see, pleasant,
strewn with golden sand, sprinkled with sandalwood water, covered over with gold trellis-work.
On every side were to be seen water basins of various kinds, formed of cubes of four
sorts, of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The steps of these basins were formed
of four materials, of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The basins were surrounded
by balustrades of four kinds, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The uprights,
borders, and handles of the golden balustrades were made of silver; those of the silver
balustrades were made of gold; those of the beryl balustrades were made of crystal,
and those of the crystal balustrades were made of beryl. These basins were full of
water which was cool and honey-sweet, were set thick with blue, red, and white lotuses,
and replete with many water-haunting birds of beautiful form, which gave agreeable
utterance to charming sounds. All around these basins grew blossoming and fruit-bearing
trees of beauteous form and stately growth, adorned with wreaths, as when an adroit
chaplet-maker or his pupil, in order to form an ornament for the ears, has deftly
woven a garland of flowers. On land, likewise, birds of various kinds, all of beauteous
form, agreeably uttered charming sounds.
</p>
<p>In the city of Sudarśana were many wishing-trees, on which four kinds of raiment grew,
blue, yellow, red, and white. Whatever garments were desired by the gods or the daughters
of the gods were obtained by them as soon as the idea came into their minds. From
the four kinds of ornament-trees came ornaments for the hand and foot, ornaments to
be worn out of sight on the lower parts of the body, and ornaments intended for the
eye. Whatever the sons or daughters of the gods wished for, that thing came into their
hands as soon as they had expressed their wish. Four kinds of musical instruments,
harps, pipes, guitars, and shells, did the gods and the daughters of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>gods hold in their hands as soon as they wished for them. Four kinds of divine food,
blue, yellow, red, and white, did the gods and the daughters of the gods obtain as
soon as they wished for them. Storied houses provided with summer chambers, courts,
windows, and peepholes, formed meeting-places for troops of women and Apsaras. There
to the sound of music, with drink made of honey and from the kadamba tree, the thirty-three
gods played, rejoiced, and took delight, enjoying the fruits of their merits. The
meeting-hall of the thirty-three gods, Sudharmā by name, which was 300 yojanas long,
300 broad, and 900 in circumference, was beautiful, charming, exquisite to look upon,
formed of crystal, and rising above the city to a height of 342 yojanas. In it were
arranged the seats of the thirty-three gods, those of the thirty-two under-kings,
and the seat of Śakra, the king of the thirty-three gods. King Māndhātar’s seat was
prepared for him at the end of all these seats. The thirty-three gods received King
Māndhātar with a gift of honour. Then there entered in by ranks those beings who had
acquired great power by the maturity of their merits, the others remaining without.
King Māndhātar said to himself, “Of the seats which are here arranged, mine is undoubtedly
the last.” And he came to the conclusion that Śakra, the king of the gods, ought to
give up to him half of his own seat. No sooner had he conceived this idea than Śakra
the king of the gods gave up to him half of his seat, and King Māndhātar shared the
seat with the king of the gods. Now when the great King Māndhātar and Śakra the king
of the gods sat on the same seat, it was impossible to see in either of them, whether
in length or breadth, in voice or in fulness of aspect, any difference from the other,
any distinction or any pre-eminence, except that Śakra the king of the gods never
closed his eyes. While King Māndhātar tarried among the thirty-three gods, thirty-six
Śakra-evanescences passed away.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>While he was there a war broke out between the gods and the Asuras. When the Asuras
were defeated, they closed the gates of the Asura city and occupied the bulwarks round
about. And when the gods were defeated, they in like manner closed the gates of the
divine city, and occupied its bulwarks round about. Now it came to pass that the Asuras,
having equipped a fourfold army, had already broken through the five defences, and
were drawing nigh unto the king of the gods, Śakra, in warlike array. The Yakshas
said to the king of the gods, Śakra, “Know, O Kauśika, that the Asuras have broken
through the five bulwarks and are near at hand. Be pleased, therefore, to accomplish
all that ought to be done and prepared.” Now when Śakra, the king of the gods, had
equipped a fourfold army and was setting out to wage war against the Asuras, King
Māndhātar turned towards him and said, “Stay here; I will take the field myself.”
Śakra replied, “Let that be done.” Then the king arose heavenward with an army eighteen
koṭi strong, and caused his bowstring to clang. When the Asuras heard this sound,
they asked whose bowstring it was that was thus clanging. Being told that the sound
was the clang of King Māndhātar’s bowstring, they were greatly astounded. King Māndhātar
arrived, and the war-chariots of the contending gods and Asuras rose high into the
air. As, in accordance with the ordering of things, no superiority or inferiority
was to be found on either side, King Māndhātar soared behind all the Asuras towards
heaven. The Asuras asked, “Who is this who has soared above us towards heaven?” Being
told that it was Māndhātar, the king of men, they reflected that, as he had risen
above their chariots, he must be a being who had attained to the glory of great power
through the fulness of his merits; and overcome, full of fear and trembling, they
turned their backs and withdrew into the stronghold of the Asuras.
</p>
<p>When King Māndhātar inquired who had gained the day, the ministers answered that he
was the conqueror. <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>Then King Māndhātar came to the conclusion that he was superior to the thirty-three
gods. He reflected that he possessed the vast, rich, prosperous, fruitful Jambudvīpa,
replete with men and living creatures; that he possessed Pūrvavidehadvīpa, Aparagodānīyadvīpa,
and Uttarakurudvīpa; that he was the owner of the seven treasures, the treasure of
the wheel, the treasure of the elephant, the treasure of the horse, the treasure of
the wife, the treasure of the householder, and, seventhly, the treasure of the minister;
that he had a full thousand of heroic, sturdy sons, endowed with the beauty of splendid
bodies, victorious over hosts of foes; that a rain of precious stones had fallen within
his palace for the space of seven days; that he had made his way to the abode of the
thirty-three gods; that he had entered into Sudharmā, the meeting-place of the gods,
and that the king of the gods, Śakra, had ceded to him the half of his seat; and he
came to the conclusion that he must expel the king of the gods, Śakra, from his seat,
and take into his own hands the government of both gods and men.
</p>
<p>As soon as he had conceived this idea the great King Māndhātar came to the end of
his good fortune. On his return to Jambudvīpa he was attacked by a violent illness,
and amid intolerable agonies he drew nigh unto death. His ministers and other state
officials, the astrologers and workers of cures by spells, betook themselves to him
and addressed him thus: “When the king shall have passed away hence, it may be that
the subsequent inhabitants of the kingdom will inquire what King Māndhātar said at
the time of his death. What shall we say to them in reply?”
</p>
<p>“O chieftains, when in time to come, after my departure, men shall draw nigh unto
you and ask you that question, then shall ye give them this answer: ‘O sirs, King
Māndhātar, who possessed the seven treasures, who with a fourfold host of men acquired
power over the four dvīpas, and made his way to the abode of the thirty-three <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>gods, is said to have died before he had obtained satisfaction through the fivefold
pleasures of sense.’ ”
</p>
<p>Moreover he pronounced these ślokas:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1778src" href="#xd31e1778">15</a>—
</p>
<p>“Even by a rain of gold pieces will wishes not be satisfied. The wise man, he who
knows that wishes bring but little enjoyment and much sorrow, takes no delight even
in divine enjoyments. The hearer of the perfected Buddha rejoices when desire fails.
Even if a mountain of gold were like unto Himavant, yet it would not suffice for the
wealth of a single individual; that the discerning one knows full well. He who observes
sorrows, starting from this base, how can he take pleasure in enjoyments? He who is
steady, who has learnt to recognise the thorn in the treasures of the world, will
learn the essence of things to his own correction.”
</p>
<p>King Māndhātar ordered irresistible sacrifices to be offered, and he said in ślokas:—
</p>
<p>“If one knows that the future lasts long but life is only brief, then ought one to
acquire merits. If one does not acquire merits, then one has sorrow. Therefore must
he who is acquiring merits offer sacrificial gifts, as is fitting. In this world and
in the future will he, if he offer up gifts, obtain happiness.”
</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the town and country heard that King Māndhātar had fallen ill and
was nigh unto death. Having learnt this, many hundreds of thousands of men assembled
in order to see King Māndhātar. The king spoke to the multitudes upon the evil of
lust and the ills of house-life, and then condemned desire. Thereupon many hundreds
of thousands of men renounced house-life, retired from the world to the Rishis, and
lived in the forest, fulfilling the four duties of Brahmans, and abandoning all striving
after enjoyment. Persevering in this, they became participators in the world of Brahma.
</p>
<p>While King Māndhātar was in his boyhood, while he was crown prince, while he exercised
supreme power in Jambudvīpa, <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>while he lived in the dvīpas of Pūrvavideha, Aparagodānīya, and Uttarakuru, and on
the seven golden mountains, and while he dwelt in the region of the thirty-three gods
to which he went, eighty-four Śakra-evanescences passed away. The measure of life
of Śakra, the prince of the five great kings, is as follows:—One hundred years of
men represent one day of the thirty-three gods. If thirty such days are reckoned as
one month, and twelve months as one year, then the measure of life of the thirty-three
gods is a hundred divine years. According to human reckoning, that amounts to 3,600,000.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1789src" href="#xd31e1789">16</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In olden times there was a mighty king named Śakuni, who was a beloved associate of
the king of the gods, Indra. In spite of this he became absorbed in meditation, leaning
his head upon his hand, reflecting that, inasmuch as he had neither a son nor a daughter,
he would have to die, in spite of his riches and his power, without leaving behind
him a son or a daughter, and that his family would become extinct. As he sat meditating
in this wise, the king of the gods, Indra, saw him and said, “O friend, wherefore
do you lean your head upon your hand, and wherefore do you sit there meditating in
that manner?”
</p>
<p>He replied, “O Kauśika, if I die without leaving a son or daughter, my family will
become extinct, in spite of my possessing such wealth and power.”
</p>
<p>Indra said, “O friend, I will send you a medicine. Let your wives drink of it, and
thereby you will obtain sons and daughters.”
</p>
<p>The king of the gods, Indra, betook himself to Mount Gandhamādana, brought away the
medicine with him, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>sent it to the king. The king sent it to his wives, with directions for them to drink
it. The king’s chief wife had just gone to sleep, but the other wives drank the medicine
without waking her, and all of them became pregnant. When the queen awoke and perceived
that they were pregnant, she said, “What have ye done to become pregnant?”
</p>
<p>They replied, “The king gave us a medicine to drink.”
</p>
<p>“Why did you drink it without waking me? As this is so, tell me in what medicine-holder
it was brought.”
</p>
<p>“It was contained in a kuśa box.”
</p>
<p>“Where is that?”
</p>
<p>“Here it is.”
</p>
<p>The queen washed the kuśa box and drank the water, whereupon she also became pregnant.
</p>
<p>After eight or nine months had passed by, all the wives gave birth to sons. The son
to whom the chief wife gave birth possessed the eighteen signs of uncomeliness, a
face like that of a lion, and an extremely strong body. His birth-feast was celebrated
in great style, and the name of Kuśa was conferred upon him. When the king looked
upon his other sons he rejoiced, but Kuśa’s ugliness excited his wrath.
</p>
<p>It came to pass that the subordinate kings said, “Honoured sirs, as King Mahāśakuni
oppresses us all so greatly, let us go up and deprive him of his power.”
</p>
<p>So they came with a fourfold host and laid siege to his capital. As King Mahāśakuni
could not venture to fight with them, he ordered all the gates to be closed and the
walls to be occupied. Kuśa went to his mother and said, “Mother, why are all the gates
shut?”
</p>
<p>“As your father cannot venture to fight with the subordinate kings, he has shut the
gates and remains within.”
</p>
<p>“Mother, as I wish to fight with them, let the king give me a chariot.”
</p>
<p>“My son, as you displease him and excite his wrath, how can he be expected to give
you a chariot?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Do go to him, mother, and having gone, tell him that the youth Kuśa will fight with
the enemy if a chariot is given him.”
</p>
<p>The king gave him a chariot, and Kuśa took two quivers, mounted the chariot, and prepared
to start. The king of gods, Indra, said to himself, “As these subordinate kings are
strong, this Bodisat of the Bhadrakalpa, the youth Kuśa, may fall into trouble, so
I will lend him aid.” And he gave Kuśa a shell, a disk, and a mace, and then said,
“Bodisat, these things will save you.”
</p>
<p>Kuśa opened one of the gates and drove out. As soon as he sounded the shell, the hostile
host was terrified at its sound; some were deafened by its clang, others fled away
with shattered ears. Whenever he flung the disk or the mace, the enemy fell to the
ground. He pressed into the midst of the host, and when he sounded the shell every
ear cracked, and the enemy fled saying, “This man is a Rākshasa.”
</p>
<p>When the youth had overthrown the whole of them, he went to his father, and told him
that he had conquered all the kings, and the land was at peace. On hearing this, King
Mahāśakuni rejoiced, and said to himself, “The youth Kuśa is strong and remarkably
brave. Why should I dislike him?” And he began to take delight in him.
</p>
<p>After arranging marriages for all his other sons, the king set to work to find a wife
for the youth Kuśa as well. But all men said, “We are ready to give our daughters,
only not to Kuśa.” Now a certain king desired to obtain another king’s daughter in
marriage, but did not succeed; and on her, by means of a trick, pretending it was
for another of his sons, King Mahāśakuni laid his hands. And he gave her to Kuśa,
and celebrated his marriage with her in consonance with the constellation, the epoch,
and the moment.
</p>
<p>Now the king had said, “Honoured sirs, let no one show the youth Kuśa a mirror. Moreover,
he must not <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>bathe in places where a man, in order to take a bath, must step into water. And he
must never be allowed to approach his wife by daylight.” But Kuśa’s wife saw him playing
with his brothers one day, and she said, “Who is that Piśācha [or demon] who is playing
with the youths?”
</p>
<p>“That is your husband.”
</p>
<p>“What! is my husband like that?”
</p>
<p>When she had seen him another day sporting with the rest of the youths in the water,
and had asked if her husband was really like that, she determined to clear the matter
up. So she lighted a lamp and covered it over with a bowl. When Kuśa had approached
his wife [by night], and she [had uncovered the lamp and] perceived that he had the
eighteen marks of unsightliness and a face like a lion’s jowl, she exclaimed, “Piśācha!
Piśācha!” and fled away.
</p>
<p>Now it came to pass that certain mountaineers rebelled against King Mahāśakuni. The
king ordered the youth Kuśa to subdue those mountaineers, and sent him forth. When
Kuśa had gone, his wife sent to say to her father and mother, “Is there no man left
in the world, that ye have given me to a Piśācha? If I am to die, well and good. But
if I am not to die, then will I take to flight.” Thereupon her parents fetched her
away. When the youth Kuśa returned home, after subduing the mountaineers, he asked
his mother what had become of his wife.
</p>
<p>“Her parents have taken her away,” she replied.
</p>
<p>“For what reason?”
</p>
<p>“Because she took you for a Piśācha.”
</p>
<p>“Mother, I will go and bring her back.”
</p>
<p>“Do so.”
</p>
<p>He took the shell, the disk, and the mace, and set out on his way. It happened that
at a certain hill-town a great number of men sat looking on one side, having closed
their gates from fear of a lion. The youth Kuśa said, “What makes you sit there like
that?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>“We do so from fear of a lion.”
</p>
<p>“Why do not you kill it?”
</p>
<p>“We cannot.”
</p>
<p>“What will you give me if I kill it?”
</p>
<p>“Half of our fourfold host.”
</p>
<p>The youth Kuśa drew near to the lion and sounded the shell. The lion’s ears burst
and it died. Kuśa took it and went to the hill-town and said, “O sirs, here is the
lion.”
</p>
<p>“Then take the half of our fourfold host.”
</p>
<p>“I will leave it in your hands. Give it to me when I come back again,” he said.
</p>
<p>He betook himself to the hill-town where his wife was, and went to the house of a
chaplet-maker, who said to him, “What are you?”
</p>
<p>“I am the son of a chaplet-maker,” he replied.
</p>
<p>“What is your name?”
</p>
<p>“Vṛiji.”
</p>
<p>As Bodisats are expert in all arts and accomplishments, he twined a splendid wreath,
which the chaplet-maker gave to the king’s daughter. The princess said, “How comes
it that you have never before made me such a wreath as this?”
</p>
<p>“It was my apprentice who made it.”
</p>
<p>“I should like to see your apprentice.”
</p>
<p>When the chaplet-maker brought him to her and she looked at the youth, she wondered
where this demon could have sprung from, and she exclaimed, “Piśācha<span class="corr" id="xd31e1885" title="Not in source">!</span> Piśācha!” Whereupon he fled. Afterwards he betook himself to the house of a cook,
who said, “Who are you?”
</p>
<p>“I am the son of a cook.”
</p>
<p>“What is your name?”
</p>
<p>“Sugandhabhājana.”
</p>
<p>As he roasted and boiled excellently, the cook served up to the king’s daughter the
boiled and roasted meats which he had cooked. She said, “O friend, who prepared this
food so excellently roasted and boiled?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>“My apprentice prepared it.”
</p>
<p>“I should like to see your apprentice.”
</p>
<p>This time also she cried out as before.
</p>
<p>He next went to a doctor, who said, “Who are you?”
</p>
<p>“A doctor’s son.”
</p>
<p>“What is your name?”
</p>
<p>“Ātreya.”
</p>
<p>The king’s daughter fell ill with a disease of the brain, and the doctor could of
himself do nothing to cure it. As he sat one day absorbed in thought on that account,
Kuśa said to him, “Master, why are you so pensive?”
</p>
<p>“The king’s daughter is attacked by a disease of the brain, and I can do nothing to
cure it.”
</p>
<p>“I will go and cure her.”
</p>
<p>So Kuśa went to visit her. When she saw him she thought, “Where can this demon have
come from?” But she reflected that if she said that aloud he would not cure her, so
she determined not to do so till he had cured her. When she became well she cried
out, “Piśācha! Piśācha!” Whereupon he fled.
</p>
<p>He betook himself to the ministers, who said, “Who are you?”
</p>
<p>“I am Sahasrabala (Thousand-strength).”
</p>
<p>They took him into their service.
</p>
<p>Now it came to pass that the son of the before-mentioned king heard that the princess,
whom Kuśa had formerly obtained, had been given up by him, and had returned home.
So he sent to say that if the king would give him his daughter, all would be well;
but if the king would not give her, he would despoil him of his sovereign power. The
king replied, “I have given my daughter to the son of King Mahāśakuni. I cannot give
her to another.” So the prince came with a fourfold army and besieged the king’s capital.
The king could not venture to fight with him, so he ordered the gates to be closed
and remained inside.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>The youth Kuśa said to the ministers, “Sirs, wherefore are the gates closed?” They
explained the whole matter to him. The youth Kuśa said to the ministers, “If the king’s
daughter is given to me, I will undertake to fight the enemy.” The ministers laid
the case before the king, who said, “I have given my daughter to the son of King Mahāśakuni.
How can I give her to this man? The present complication is entirely due to this maiden.”
The ministers said, “As there is at present no other prospect of victory, let this
man fight the prince offhand. We shall find out then which is the conqueror.” The
king said, “Let that be done by you.” And the ministers said, “Thousand-strength,
act according to your words.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the youth took the two quivers, which held five hundred arrows, and also
the shell, the disk, and the mace, and set forth. When he sounded the shell, the ears
of the enemy were shattered, and they fled. The princess thought, “As this youth Kuśa
is excellently endowed with boldness and courage, why should I dislike him?” So she
took a liking for him, and said to the king, “What you promised, that fulfil.”
</p>
<p>“Daughter, I will give you to Kuśa.”
</p>
<p>“Father,” she said, “this is the youth Kuśa himself.”
</p>
<p>“Go to him then, daughter, since that is so.”
</p>
<p>The king paid Kuśa great honour, gave him a fourfold host, and let him and the rest
of his party go free.
</p>
<p>Kuśa went to the other hill-town, and said to the inhabitants, “Honoured sirs, now
give me the half of the fourfold army.” They replied, “O youth, such a flood has taken
place as has washed away the four divisions of the army.” As there were sheep grazing
at no great distance, the youth Kuśa uttered this saying, “Reflect and know that whither
the sixty-year old bullock, whither the elephant has been brought, thither also will
the cows and sheep be brought. If ye give me the army, good. If ye give it not, there
will be a tussle for it.”
</p>
<p>After the army had been given to him he went down to <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>a river. Being wearied, he entered the water to bathe; and as he did so he saw the
reflection of his face in the water, and thought, “As I have the eighteen signs of
uncomeliness and a face like a lion, and as on that account the king’s daughter takes
no pleasure in me, it is needless that such a one as I should remain alive. I will
go and put myself to death.”
</p>
<p>He entered into a copse, and was preparing to hang himself, when the king of the gods,
Indra, reflected, “As this is a Bodisat of the Bhadrakalpa, and he is going to hang
himself because he does not possess a beautiful appearance, I will fill his mind with
hope.” So Indra said to him, “Youth, despair not! And in order that you may not kill
yourself, set this jewel upon your head, and your courage will be restored to you.”
Then Indra vanished.
</p>
<p>When the youth Kuśa was going to enter into his house, the doorkeeper kept him back,
saying, “Do not intrude here, for this is the house of the youth Kuśa.” “I am Kuśa,”
he replied. As the doorkeeper would not believe him, Kuśa removed the jewel from his
head. Then his appearance became what it had been before, so that the doorkeeper now
believed him.
</p>
<p>The youth Kuśa resolved to remain at that spot, and to let his father know. So he
sent word to him saying, “I shall stay here.”
</p>
<p>The king of the gods, Indra, pointed out to him the locality of four treasures. Kuśa
had a city built of the four precious stones, and it was named Kuśinagara, inasmuch
as the youth Kuśa abode there. He became the mightily ruling Chakravartin Kuśa.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To King <span class="corr" id="xd31e1945" title="Source: Ananda">Ānanda</span> there were born five sons. The youngest of these, inasmuch as his face resembled
a mirror, was named Ādarśamukha or Mirror-face. All five sons grew up. Prince Ādarśamukha
was very gentle and modest, but the others were rash, rude, and hot-tempered. Their
father called them together one day on a matter of business. The minds of the elder
brothers were incapable of deciding the smallest of its points, but Prince Ādarśamukha
answered with intelligence the difficult questions which were proposed to him.
</p>
<p>Being attacked by illness, King Ānanda considered as to whom he should invest with
the sovereign power. “If I invest one of my four elder sons with the power,” he thought,
“inasmuch as they are rash, rude, and hot-tempered, misfortunes will unduly increase
among men; but if I invest Prince Ādarśamukha with the power, then my kinsmen will
reproach me for having passed over my elder sons and given the power to the youngest.
It is necessary, therefore, that I should devise some way of escape.”
</p>
<p>With that intention he decided in his mind on three <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>precious things, and on a recognition by the women, and on six objects to be recognised
by insight. Then he said to his ministers, “Give ear, O chieftains! After my death
ye are to test each of the princes in turn. Him among them whom the jewel-shoes fit
when they are tried on, under whom the throne remains steadfast when he is set upon
it, on whom the diadem, rests unshaken when it is placed upon his head, whom the women
recognise, and who guesses the six objects to be divined by his insight, namely, the
inner treasure, the outer treasure, the inner and outer treasure, the treasure of
the tree-top, the treasure of the hill-top, and the treasure of the river shore—him
by whom all these conditions are fulfilled shall ye invest with the sovereign power.”
</p>
<p>Then, according to the proverb which says that all which has been accumulated dwindles,
and all that is high will meet with a fall, he died. Now when the ministers tried
to place the jewel-shoes on the feet of the eldest prince, the shoes did not fit.
When he was set upon the throne, it moved. When the diadem was placed upon his head,
it shook greatly. Moreover the women did not recognise him. And when he was told the
names of the six objects which were to be divined by his insight, he did not guess
them. The fate of three of his younger brothers was just the same. But when the jewel-shoes
were placed upon Prince Ādarśamukha’s feet, they fitted him perfectly. When he was
set upon the throne, it remained unmoved. When he was crowned with the diadem, his
head looked forth from beneath it proudly. Moreover the women recognised him. Then
the ministers said, “Now you must find out the six objects to be divined by insight,
namely, the inner treasure, the outer treasure, the inner and outer treasure, the
treasure of the tree-top, the treasure of the hill-top, and the treasure of the river
shore.” Ādarśamukha replied, “If the question is which is the inner treasure, that
is the treasure which is inside the threshold. If the question is which is the outer
treasure, <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>that is the treasure which is outside the threshold. If the question is which is the
treasure of the tree-top, that is the treasure which is at the spot on which the tree
planted by the king casts its shadow at midday. If the question is which is the treasure
of the hill-top, that is the treasure which is under the stone at the bottom of the
tank wherein the king used to take delight. If the question is which is the treasure
of the river shore, that is the treasure which is at the end of the channel by which
the water flows out of the house.” As all the problems were solved, the ministers
made Ādarśamukha king, and he became a mighty monarch.
</p>
<p>In a certain place among the hills there lived a Brahman named Daṇḍin, who borrowed
a pair of oxen from a householder. After ploughing his land, he went with the oxen
to the householder’s dwelling. As the man was at his dinner, the Brahman Daṇḍin let
the oxen go to their stall; but they went out again by another door. When the householder
arose from his meal and found that the oxen had disappeared, he seized Daṇḍin and
asked where the oxen were. Daṇḍin replied, “Did not I bring them back to your house?”
“As you have stolen my oxen, give them back to me,” said the other. Daṇḍin replied,
“I have not stolen them.” The other said, “King Ādarśamukha is wise. Let us go to
him; he will settle this affair for us, separating the right from the wrong.” So they
both set out on their way.
</p>
<p>A man from whom a mare had run away called out to Daṇḍin to stop it. He asked how
he was to stop it. The man told him to do so in any way he could. Daṇḍin picked up
a stone and flung it at the mare’s head, the consequence of which was that the mare
was killed. The man said, “As you have killed my mare, give me another one.” Daṇḍin
said, “Why should I give you a mare?” The man replied, “Come, let us go to King Ādarśamukha;
he will settle our business for us.” So they set off to go to him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>Daṇḍin tried to run away. As he sprang down from a wall, he fell on a weaver who was
at his work below, in consequence of which the weaver died. The weaver’s wife laid
hands upon Daṇḍin and demanded that he, as he had killed her husband, should restore
him to her. “Where am I to get your husband from for you?” he said. “Come, let us
go to King Ādarśamukha,” she replied; “he will settle our business for us.” So they
went their way.
</p>
<p>About half-way they came to a deep river, which a carpenter was fording, his axe in
his mouth. Daṇḍin asked him if the river was deep or shallow. The carpenter, letting
his axe drop, said, “The river is deep.” Then, as his axe had fallen into the water,
he seized Daṇḍin and said, “You have flung my axe into the water.”
</p>
<p>“No, I have not.”
</p>
<p>“Come, let us go to King Ādarśamukha; he will settle our business for us.”
</p>
<p>By and by they who were leading Daṇḍin along came to a drinking-house. In it Daṇḍin
sat down upon the landlady’s new-born babe, which was lying asleep under a dress.
“There’s a child lying there! There’s a child lying there!” cried the mother. But
when she looked at it, the child was dead. She seized on Daṇḍin and demanded that
he, who had killed her child, should give it back to her. He replied, “I did not kill
it. Why should I give you a child?” She said, “Come, let us go to King Ādarśamukha.”
So they set out on their way.
</p>
<p>At a certain spot a crow which sat on a withered tree saw Daṇḍin, and asked him whither
he was going. He replied, “I am not going anywhere, but I am being taken by these
people.”
</p>
<p>“Whither?”
</p>
<p>“To King Ādarśamukha’s.”
</p>
<p>“Then take charge of a commission from me, and say to King Ādarśamukha, ‘At such and
such a spot there <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>stands a tree with dry leaves. On this tree sits a crow which wants to ask you what
is the reason why it remains upon that tree, and takes no delight in other trees which
are green and full of sap.’ ”
</p>
<p>They went farther, and some gazelles saw Daṇḍin and asked him whither he was going.
He replied, “I am not going anywhere, but am being taken by these people.”
</p>
<p>“Whither?”
</p>
<p>“To King Ādarśamukha’s.”
</p>
<p>“Then take charge of a commission from us, and ask the king what is the reason why
we find no pleasure in any other place than this, though other places possess meadows
and green grass.”
</p>
<p>They went on farther. A partridge saw them and asked whither they were going, and
all went on as above up to the words, “Then take charge of a commission from me also,
and ask the king why I call like a partridge at one spot, and at another spot I have
a different kind of voice.”
</p>
<p>Elsewhere they saw a snake, and just the same as before happened up to the utterance
of the words, “Then take charge of a commission from me also, and ask the king why
I creep out of my hole with ease, but creep back into it only with pain.”
</p>
<p>A snake and an ichneumon, which had quarrelled and were fighting with one another,
likewise begged that the king might be asked on what account they, as soon as they
saw each other, day by day became angry and began to fight. A young wife also commissioned
them to ask wherefore she, so long as she lived in her father’s house, longed after
the house of her father-in-law, but now, since she entered her father-in-law’s house,
longed after the house of her father.
</p>
<p>They went on and came to King Ādarśamukha’s; then Daṇḍin wished the king long life
and victory, and took a seat at a certain spot, and the others also seated themselves.
After they had paid reverence with their heads <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>to the king’s feet, the king asked Daṇḍin, “Wherefore have you come?”
</p>
<p>“O king, I have been brought hither.”
</p>
<p>“On what account?”
</p>
<p>Daṇḍin related the whole story of why the householder had quarrelled with him. The
king said to the householder, “Did you see the oxen, or did you not see them? Did
Daṇḍin drive your oxen into the stalls?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, O king.”
</p>
<p>The king said, “As Daṇḍin gave this man no information, his tongue shall be cut off.
As this man did not tie up his oxen, his eyes shall be put out.”
</p>
<p>The householder said, “First I lost my oxen, in the second place my eyes are to be
put out. Sooner than that, I prefer not to win my suit against Daṇḍin.”
</p>
<p>The owner of the mare said, “O king, Daṇḍin has killed my mare.”
</p>
<p>“How did he kill it?”
</p>
<p>The man told the whole story in full. The king said, “As this man told him he might
stop the mare by any means whatsoever, his tongue shall be cut off; but Daṇḍin shall
have his hand cut off, because he thought it impossible to stop the mare except by
throwing a stone at it.”
</p>
<p>The man said to himself, “First my mare died, now my tongue is to be cut off. Sooner
than that, I prefer not to gain my suit against Daṇḍin.”
</p>
<p>The weaver’s wife told her story in full, and the king said, “Then you shall receive
this man as your husband.” She said, “First of all this man killed my husband, and
now he is to be my husband. Sooner than that, I prefer not to win my suit against
Daṇḍin.”
</p>
<p>The carpenter fully explained his case. The king said, “As the carpenter spoke in
the middle of the river and let his axe fall, his tongue shall be cut off; but Daṇḍin’s
eyes shall be put out, because he, although he saw that the river was deep, asked
the carpenter about it.” The carpenter said, “First I lost my axe, now my tongue is
<span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>to be cut off. Sooner than that, I prefer not to win my suit against Daṇḍin.”
</p>
<p>The landlady told her story in full, and the king said, “As the landlady left her
child sleeping with a dress completely hiding it, her hand shall be cut off; but Daṇḍin
shall have his eyes put out, because he sat down on an unfamiliar seat without making
any investigation.”
</p>
<p>The landlady said, “First my child died, now my hand is to be cut off. Sooner than
that, I prefer not to win my suit against Daṇḍin.”
</p>
<p>Daṇḍin presented the crow’s petition. The king said, “O Daṇḍin, say this to the crow:
‘At that spot there is a treasure, which was hidden away under the withered tree by
you when you were the head man of the village. Give it to some one or other and then
go away, and you will fare well.’ ”
</p>
<p>Daṇḍin executed the commission of the gazelles. The king said, “Tell the gazelles
this: ‘O gazelles, there stands a tree on that spot from the top of which honey drops
down. Thereby are the meadows and the grass rendered sweet. But as the bees have now
been driven out, do not tarry any longer on the spot, otherwise ye will suffer pain
beyond measure.’ ”
</p>
<p>Daṇḍin brought forward the request of the partridge. The king said, “Tell the partridge
this: ‘Where you possess a partridge’s voice, there no treasure is to be found; but
where you have a different voice, there a treasure is to be found. Point out this
treasure to some one or other, and then, as it is not right that you should suffer
pain beyond measure, betake yourself somewhere else.’ ”
</p>
<p>Daṇḍin mentioned the request of the snake and the ichneumon, and the king said, “Tell
both of them this: ‘When ye were men, ye were born as two brothers. One of the two
said, “Let us divide our property.” But the other, overcome by envy, would not consent
to the division. On that account the one, being too covetous, was born again as a
snake; but the other, inasmuch as he was <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>excessively covetous and clung to the property, was born as an ichneumon. Do ye then
give these treasures to the <span class="corr" id="xd31e2011" title="Source: Śramanas">Śramaṇas</span> or the Brahmans, and then leave that spot. By that means will ye fare well.’ ”
</p>
<p>Daṇḍin brought forward the snake’s request, and the king said, “Say this to the snake:
‘When hungry and in a state of collapse, you can easily creep out of your hole. But
when you have partaken of copious food, then it is only with pain that you can creep
back into the hole. If you can content yourself with so much food as is fit for you,
you will fare well.’ ”
</p>
<p>Daṇḍin mentioned the young wife’s request, and the king said, “Tell the young wife
this: ‘In your father’s house there is a friend. When you are in your father-in-law’s
house, you long after that friend; but when you are in your father’s house, you long
after your husband. As it is not right that you should suffer pain beyond measure,
give up the one place of residence and take up your abode permanently in the other.’ ”
</p>
<p>The young wife and the snake did what they were told to do. The snake and the ichneumon,
as well as the crow, made over their treasures to Daṇḍin. The others likewise acted
in accordance with the instructions given to them.

<h2 class="main">THE CLEVER THIEF.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2026src" href="#xd31e2026">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In olden times there lived in a hill-town a householder, who married a wife of his
own caste. When a son was born unto him, he said to his wife, “Goodwife, now that
there is born unto us a causer of debts and diminisher of means, I will take merchandise
and go to sea.” She replied, “Do so, lord.” So he went to sea with his merchandise,
and there he died.
</p>
<p>After his wife had got over her mourning, she continued to live, partly supported
by her handiwork, and partly by her relatives. Not far from her dwelt a weaver who
was <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>skilled in his art, and who by means of adroitness succeeded in everything. Seeing
that he, by means of his art, had become well to do, she came to the conclusion that
weaving was better than going to sea, for when a man did the latter, he needlessly
exposed himself to misfortune. So she said to the weaver, “O brother, teach this nephew
of yours to weave.” He replied, “As that is right, I will do so.” The youth became
his apprentice, and in a short time learnt the art of weaving, for he was sharp and
quick.
</p>
<p>As the weaver wore fine clothes, took good baths, and partook of delicate food, the
youth said to him one day, “Uncle, how is it that although you and I are occupied
in exactly the same kind of work, yet you have fine clothes, good baths, and delicate
food, but I never have a chance of such things?” The weaver replied, “Nephew, I carry
on two kinds of work. By day I practise weaving, but by night thieving.”
</p>
<p>“If that be so, uncle, I too will practise thieving.”
</p>
<p>“Nephew, you cannot commit a theft.”
</p>
<p>“Uncle, I can.”
</p>
<p>The weaver thought he would test him a little, so he took him to the market-place,
purchased a hare there, and gave it to him, saying, “Nephew, I shall take a bath and
then return home. Meanwhile, go on roasting this hare.” While he was taking his bath,
the youth hastily roasted the hare and ate up one of its legs. When the weaver returned
from his bath, he said, “Nephew, have you roasted the hare?”
</p>
<p>“Yes!”
</p>
<p>“Let’s see it, then.”
</p>
<p>When the youth had brought the hare, and the weaver saw that it only had three legs,
he said, “Nephew, where is the fourth leg gone?”
</p>
<p>“Uncle, it is true that hares have four legs, but if the fourth leg is not there,
it cannot have gone anywhere.”
</p>
<p>The weaver thought, “Although I have long been a <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>thief, yet this lad is a still greater thief.” And he went with the youth and the
three-legged hare into a drinking-house and called for liquor. When they had both
drunk, the weaver said, “Nephew, the score must be paid by a trick.”
</p>
<p>“Uncle, he who has drunk may play a trick; why should I, who have not drunk, do this
thing?”
</p>
<p>The weaver saw that the lad was a great swindler, so he determined to carry out a
theft along with him.
</p>
<p>They betook themselves to housebreaking. Once when they had made a hole into a house,
and the weaver was going to pass his head through the opening, the youth said, “Uncle,
although you are a thief, yet you do not understand your business. The legs should
be put in first, not the head. For if the head should get cut off, its owner would
be recognised, and his whole family would be plunged into ruin. Therefore put your
feet in first.”
</p>
<p>When the weaver had done so, attention was called to the fact, and a cry was raised
of “Thieves! thieves!” At that cry a great number of people assembled, who seized
the weaver by his legs and began to pull him in. The youth, all by himself, could
not succeed in pulling him out; but he cut off the weaver’s head and got away with
it.
</p>
<p>The ministers brought the news to the king, saying, “Your majesty, the thief was himself
arrested at the spot where the housebreaking took place; but some one cut off his
head and went away with it.” The king said, “O friends, he who has cut off the head
and gone away with it is a great thief. Go and expose the headless trunk at the crossway
of the main street. Then place yourselves on one side, and arrest whoever embraces
it and wails over it, for that will be the thief.” Thereupon those servants of the
king exposed the headless trunk at the crossway of the main street, and stationed
themselves on one side. Thinking it would be wrong not to embrace <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>his uncle and moan over him, the other thief assumed the appearance of a madman, and
took to embracing men, women, carts, horses, bullocks, buffaloes, goats, and dogs.
Afterwards, all men thinking he was mad, he pressed the headless trunk to his breast,
wailed over it as long as he liked, and then went his way. The king was informed by
his men that a madman had pressed the headless trunk to his bosom, and while he held
it there had wailed over it, and had then gone away. The king said, “O friends, this
man of a surety was the other thief. Ye have acted wrongly in not laying hands upon
him. Therefore shall hands be laid upon you.”
</p>
<p>The other thief said to himself, “If I do not show honour to my uncle, I shall be
acting badly.” So he assumed the appearance of a carter, and drove a cart up to the
spot laden with dry wood. When he arrived there, he upset the cart with its load of
dry wood, unyoked the oxen, set the cart on fire, and then went away. The headless
trunk was consumed by the flames. The king was informed by his men that the corpse
was burnt, and they told him all that had taken place. The king said, “O friends,
the carter was certainly the thief. Ye have acted wrongly in not laying hands upon
him. Therefore shall hands be laid upon you.”
</p>
<p>The thief said to himself, “I shall not be acting rightly unless I take soul-offerings
to the burial-place for my uncle.” So he assumed the appearance of a Brahman, and
wandered from house to house collecting food. From what he collected he made five
oblation-cakes, which he left at the burial-place, and then went his way. The king’s
men told him that a Brahman had wandered from house to house collecting food, and
had then left five oblation-cakes on the spot where the body had been burnt, and had
then gone away. The king said, “O friends, that was really the thief. Ye have acted
wrongly in not laying hands upon him.”
</p>
<p>The thief thought, “I shall be acting badly if I do not <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>throw my uncle’s bones into the Ganges.” So he assumed the appearance of a Kāpālika,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2064src" href="#xd31e2064">2</a> went to the place where the corpse had been burnt, smeared his body with ashes, filled
a skull with bones and ashes, flung it into the Ganges, and then went his way. When
the king had been told by his men all that had happened, he said, “O friends, this
was really the thief. Ye have acted wrongly in not laying hands upon him. In order
to bring the matter to an end, do ye let it alone. I will lay hands on the man myself.”
</p>
<p>The king had a garden laid out at a spot where the Ganges formed a bay, and he set
men to watch on both of its shores. In it he stationed his very beautiful daughter
on the shore of the river, giving her orders to cry aloud in case any one tried to
touch her. To the watchmen also he gave orders to repair to the park as soon as they
heard any sound, and if any man was found there, to seize him and bring him before
him. Now the thief thought that he must not allow the opportunity of enjoying the
king’s daughter to slip out of his hands. So he took an empty pitcher, went down to
the shore of the Ganges, and began to draw water. As he was carrying the first pitcherful,
the watchmen came running up, thinking that he was the thief, and hit him a blow,
in consequence of which the pitcher was broken. As he was carrying the second pitcherful,
his pitcher was broken in the same way. But after this had happened three times, the
watchmen came to the conclusion that he was a water-carrier, and paid him no more
attention. Then the thief covered his head with a pot, and swam down the stream to
the bay. There he came ashore and said to the maiden, “If you utter a single cry you
shall die.” In her fright she remained silent. He tarried awhile with her, and then
went his way. The watchmen did not know what to do, seeing that she had made no noise
while the thief tarried with her, and had not begun to cry <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>till he had satisfied himself and gone away; but they gave the king a full account
of what had taken place. The king said, “It is a bad business that he was not caught.”
</p>
<p>The result of the thief’s visit was that, after eight or nine months had elapsed,
the princess bore a son. When the thief heard of this, he decided that he must not
miss his son’s birth-feast, so he assumed the appearance of a courtier [and betook
himself to the king’s palace]. As he was leaving the palace he called out to the royal
servants, “O friends, by order of the king, plunder the merchants’ quarter!” As the
servants thought that the king had given permission for the plundering of the merchants’
quarter in honour of his grandson’s birth, they set to work thereat. In consequence
of this a great outcry arose, and the king asked what was the meaning of it. When
the ministers had supplied him with a full account, the king said, “If this be so,
I also have been taken in by him. Wherefore, if I do not punish him, I shall lose
my throne.”
</p>
<p>With this idea in view he caused an enclosure to be made, and, after some little time
had elapsed, he ordered his ministers to make public through the realm a proclamation
to the effect that all men who dwelt in the kingdom were bound to assemble within
that enclosure; and that no excuse would avail, but if any one did not appear he should
be punished. When the ministers had made this order public, and all the inhabitants
of the realm were assembled together, the king gave the boy a wreath of flowers, and
told him to give it to the man who was his father; and he gave orders to the watchmen
to lay hands upon the man to whom the boy should give the wreath. As the boy walked
with the wreath through the assembled crowds and closely observed them, he caught
sight of the thief, and, in accordance with the incomprehensible sequence of human
affairs, handed him the wreath. The king’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>watchmen seized the thief and brought him before the king. The king asked his ministers
what ought to be done. They were of opinion that the thief must be put to death. But
the king said, “O friends, so little does such a hero of a man deserve to be put to
death, that he ought much rather to be carefully watched over.” Thereupon he endowed
his daughter with ornaments of all sorts, and gave her to the thief as his wife, and
bestowed upon her the half of his kingdom.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2077src" href="#xd31e2077">3</a>

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e2026src">1</a></span> Kah-gyur, iv. 132–135. One of the oldest of popular tales is the story told by Herodotus
(bk. ii. chap. 121) of the treasury of Rhampsinitus, which its builder’s two sons
are in the habit of robbing, until one of the thieves is caught in the snares set
for their feet, whereupon the other, to prevent a discovery, cuts off his brother’s
head and runs away. The king gives orders to expose the corpse, and to keep watch
so as to see whether any one weeps and wails over it. The surviving son, forced by
his mother’s threats to look after his brother’s burial, comes to the spot provided
with skins of wine, makes the watchmen drunk, shaves off the right side of their beards,
and carries away the dead body. Thereupon the king’s daughter is obliged to yield
herself to every one who will relate to her the cleverest and most scandalous trick
he has ever played in his life. The doer of the deed comes and betrays himself. But
when the princess tries to seize him, he leaves in her hold, not his own hand, but
that of the dead man. At last the king promises his daughter’s hand to the doer of
this deed, so the thief reveals himself and receives the princess. As a like legend
is connected with the treasury of Hyrieus in Orchomenus, where Trophonius cut off
the head of his brother Agamedes (Pausan. ix. 37), and as according to Charax (Schol.
ad Aristoph. Nubes, v. 508) the same story is told also of the treasury of Augeias
at Elis, we can easily understand why some commentators, like C.&nbsp;O. Müller, wish to
claim the legend for the Greeks, while Buttmann (Mythol. ii. 228) wishes to trace
it to the East. See Liebrecht in his edition of Dunlop’s “History of Fiction,” p.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In olden times there were two kings in Panchāla, one in the north and the other in
the south. The king of North Panchāla, whose name was Dhana, like a law-observing
monarch, ruled according to the law in Hastināpura, a city which was endowed with
wealth, health, fruitfulness, and greatness of extent and population, and which was
free from disquiet, disorder, uproar, and robbery, in which disease had quite come
to an end, and which was fully provided with rice, sugar-cane, bullocks, and buffaloes.
Moreover in this city there was a great lake, full of blue, red, and white lotuses,
and rendered pleasant and beautiful by ducks and geese of various kinds. As the Nāga
Janmachitra,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2109src" href="#xd31e2109">2</a> who dwelt in this lake, sent down from time to time a torrent of rain, the land was
very fruitful; and as the realm overflowed with food and drink, the inhabitants, intent
upon gifts, sacrifices, and reverence, bestowed sustenance upon the Śramaṇas and Brahmans,
and the poor and needy.
</p>
<p>The king of South Panchāla, who paid no respect to the law, was haughty, choleric,
passionate, and ill-natured. He did not rule in accordance with the law, and he <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>kept the inhabitants of his realm constantly in fear by penalties, blows, wounds,
executions, arrests, and bonds, and by intolerance, inaccessibility, and malice of
every kind. As he was overweening and did not rule according to law, the deity did
not let rain fall from time to time, on which account men, full of fear and despair,
deserted the country in troops, and betook themselves to the realm of the king of
North Panchāla.
</p>
<p>Some time after this, when the king of South Panchāla had gone to the chase and had
set forth to inspect his domains, he remarked that all the towns and villages were
deserted, and the parks and the temples of the gods had fallen into decay and ruin.
Having observed this, he said to his ministers, “Honoured sirs, what is the reason
of these towns and villages being deserted, and of the parks and the temples of the
gods having fallen into decay and ruin? and whither have the people gone?” The ministers
replied, “They have gone into the realm of Dhana, the king of North Panchāla.”
</p>
<p>“On what account?”
</p>
<p>“Will your majesty accord impunity of speech?”
</p>
<p>“Speak, for I accord you impunity.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon they said, “Your majesty, as the king of North Panchāla rules in accordance
with the law, his land is great, rich, healthy, fruitful, densely peopled, free from
disquiet, discord, disorder, uproar, and robbery; diseases have quite disappeared
there, it overflows with rice, sugar-cane, oxen, and buffaloes; and its people, intent
upon bestowing gifts, sacrifices, and reverence, offer sustenance to the Śramaṇas
and Brahmans, and the poor and needy. But as you, your majesty, are choleric, passionate,
and ill-natured, and have kept the inhabitants of the realm constantly in fear by
means of penalties, blows, wounds, executions, arrests, and bonds, and by intolerance,
inaccessibility, and malice of every kind, therefore have the people, full of fear
and despair, gone into the land of the king of North Panchāla.” The king of South
Panchāla <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>said, “O sirs, what would be a good way of making those people return and inhabit
these towns and villages?” The ministers replied, “If your majesty, ruling after the
fashion of the king of North Panchāla, will protect the land with gentle, benignant,
and merciful mind, the people will soon return and inhabit these towns and villages.”
The king of South Panchāla said, “Sirs, since this is so, I will protect the land
with gentle, benignant, and merciful mind, ruling after the fashion of the king of
North Panchāla; but do ye take such measures that the people may come back again and
inhabit these towns and villages.”
</p>
<p>“Your majesty, there is yet another cause for the state of things in Hastināpura.
In that city there is a Nāga named Janmachitra, who dwells in a great lake filled
with blue, red, and white lotuses of all kinds, and adorned with ducks and geese of
divers species. As he sends down a torrent of rain from time to time, the harvest
is always abundant and the soil is extremely fertile, and the land abounds in meat
and drink.” The king said, “Is there no means of summoning that Nāga hither?”
</p>
<p>“Your majesty, as he can be conjured hither by men who are versed in charms and spells,
let them perform the deed.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the king fastened a golden basket to the end of a standard, and ordered
proclamation to be made throughout the whole kingdom that he would give that golden
basket to any one who could conjure the Nāga Janmachitra out of North Panchāla into
South Panchāla, and would also heap upon him a profusion of great honours. After a
time a serpent-charmer appeared before the ministers, and said that if the golden
basket was given to him he would capture and bring in the Nāga Janmachitra. The ministers
ordered the basket to be brought, and the serpent-charmer said, “I will leave this
basket in the hands of a trustworthy man. Let him give it to me when I bring the Nāga
Janmachitra.” When this had <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>been promised him, the serpent-charmer placed the golden basket in the hands of a
trustworthy man and betook himself to the city of Hastināpura. Being well versed in
signs, he perceived, after carefully observing the lake all round, that the Nāga Janmachitra
must have his dwelling-place in a certain spot. So he went to fetch offerings and
utensils, and said to the ministers, “Give me offerings and utensils, and within seven
days I will capture and bring in the Nāga.”
</p>
<p>Now the Nāga had seen the serpent-charmer, and had said to himself, “This man has
come to carry me off, and if at the end of seven days I am carried off, I shall suffer
great distress on account of being severed from my parents. What shall I do? To whom
shall I pray for protection?”
</p>
<p>Now there lived in the neighbourhood of the lake two hunters, Masūraka and Phalaka.
Living near the lake, they supported themselves by killing not only land animals,
such as the hares, stags, boars, and so forth which came to that lake to drink, but
also the fish, tortoises, and so forth which lived in the water. Of these two hunters
Masūraka died, but Phalaka remained alive. As the Nāga Janmachitra came to the conclusion
that there was no one except the hunter Phalaka to whom he could fly for refuge, he
went, after assuming the form of a man, to the hunter Phalaka, and said to him, “O
friend, if King Dhana’s realm is vast, rich, healthy, fruitful, and populous, and
overflows with rice, sugar-cane, oxen, and buffaloes (as was said above), do you know
through whose power this has come to pass?” The hunter answered, “Well do I know that
this takes place because that king rules in accordance with the law, and protects
his land with gentle, benignant, and merciful mind.” The Nāga said, “Does all this
arise from that cause only, or from some other cause as well?” The hunter said, “There
is another cause as well. In this lake lives the Nāga Janmachitra, who from time to
time sends down a torrent of rain, in consequence of which the soil becomes extremely
fertile, <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>and is replete with food and drink.” Janmachitra said, “If this Nāga were to be taken
away from this land by any one, he would no longer be able to be of service, and he
would be very wretched on account of being separated from his parents. What would
the king and the inhabitants of the land do if he were to be carried off? what would
you do?”
</p>
<p>“We should perish.”
</p>
<p>“Do you know who this Nāga is?”
</p>
<p>“No!”
</p>
<p>“I am he, and a serpent-charmer from South Panchāla wishes to carry me off. He has
gone back to fetch offerings and utensils, and will return in seven days. He will
then drive pegs of Khadira-wood<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2141src" href="#xd31e2141">3</a> into the shore of the lake at its four corners, will hang up various threads of different
colours, and will recite spells. During that time you must remain hidden somewhere
near. But when, as he is performing a ceremony of this kind, the waters of the lake
begin to seethe and overflow, and I come forth from them, then you must bend your
bow against the serpent-charmer, and run up to him quickly and say, ‘Reverse the spell.
If you do not do so I shall sever your head from your body and send it to the bottom
of the lake.’ But if he dies without reversing the spell, then, even after his death,
I shall remain bound by its force all my life long.” The hunter said, “As I would
have done this of my own accord, were it merely for the sake of doing you a service,
how much the more shall I be ready to protect you, inasmuch as I shall be doing a
service to the whole kingdom. Say no more.”
</p>
<p>The Nāga then took up his abode in a lonely spot. When seven days had passed, the
hunter hid himself near that place. The serpent-charmer came and began to prepare
the offerings and utensils, driving in the pegs of <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>Khadira-wood at the four corners, attaching various threads of divers colours, and
reciting spells. When the water began to seethe, the hunter sped an arrow from his
bow, and then drew his sword from its sheath and cried, “Will you carry off the Nāga
who dwells in our land by means of spells? Reverse your spell. If you do not, I will
sever your head from your body and send it to the bottom of the lake.” The serpent-charmer,
experiencing pain and grief induced by anguish and fear of death, reversed the spell,
whereupon the hunter instantly killed him. When the Nāga was thus freed from the power
of the spell, he came forth from the lake, embraced the hunter, and thus addressed
him, “You are my mother, you are my father. In this wise am I, in that I trusted in
you, spared the pain of being separated from my parents. Come, let us go to them.”
He led him to their abode, regaled him with meats and drinks of divers kinds, presented
him with jewels, and then said to his parents, “This man has become my refuge, my
friend, and my kinsman. Through his means I have been saved from separation from you.”
The parents also let him have all he wished for, and presented him with precious things
of all kinds. These he took away with him, and then came forth from the lake.
</p>
<p>Not far from the lake was a hermitage, rich in flowers, and fruits, and birds which
uttered varied notes. Therein a Rishi abode, full of gentleness, mercy, and kindness
towards living creatures. To this Rishi the hunter was wont to go daily, in the morning,
at midday, and in the evening. To him he gave a full account of what had taken place
between him and the Nāga Janmachitra. The Rishi said to him, “What need have you of
jewels and gold? That habitation contains the Amogha-chain<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2152src" href="#xd31e2152">4</a> (i.e., that which holds fast). You must ask for that.” As a desire for that Amogha-chain
arose within the hunter’s mind, he followed the advice of the Rishi, and again betook
himself to the abode of the Nāgas. There <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>he saw the Amogha-chain at the entrance of the Nāgas’ abode, and perceiving that it
was the chain which he wanted, he entered into the abode. The Nāga Janmachitra and
the other Nāgas were delighted, and they gave him jewels. But he said, “Jewels I want
not; rather give me the Amogha-chain.” Janmachitra replied, “What need have you of
it? To us it is most needful. When the Garuḍa plagues us, it is to this chain that
we are indebted for safety.” The hunter said, “As ye are but seldom threatened with
danger from the Garuḍa, therefore it is not so very necessary for you. But I am constantly
in want of it. Therefore give it to me, if ye are mindful of the benefit conferred
and the service performed.” The Nāga Janmachitra said, “As this man has done me a
great service, I will give him the chain, after I have asked my father and mother.”
After asking his parents, he give him the chain. Thereupon the hunter, as if he had
recovered himself, returned home from the <span class="corr" id="xd31e2157" title="Source: Nāga’s">Nāgas’</span> abode with the Amogha-chain, full of happiness and joy.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>King Dhana and his wife had neither son nor daughter. It happened once that he sat,
resting his cheek upon his hand, absorbed by the thought that, since he had neither
son nor daughter, his family would be extinct after his death, the treasures heaped
up within his house would pass into other hands, and another king would rule over
all that had been his. As he sat there thus absorbed in meditation, the Śramaṇas and
Brahmans, his friends, companions, and kinsmen, asked him why he was so downcast.
When he had fully explained the whole matter to them, they said, “Be pleased to pray
to the gods. Then will a son be born unto you.” As he had no son, but desired to have
one, he prayed to Śiva and Varuṇa, to Kuvera and Vasudeva, and so forth, also to various
other gods, to the gods of the parks, the gods of the forest, the gods of the crossways,
the gods of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>three ways, the gods who accept oblations, the ever-accompanying gods, and the gods
like-minded and identical in date of birth. It is generally said that sons and daughters
are born in consequence of such prayers, not otherwise; a thousand sons, for instance,
may be born to a world-ruling prince when such prayers have been offered.
</p>
<p>Praying in such a manner, Dhana obtained a hearing, and a Bodisat of the Bhadrakalpa
entered into the womb of his good spouse. Some women who are endowed with insight
possess five peculiar characteristics, one of which is that they know whether their
child will be a boy or a girl. If it is a boy, it clings to the right side, and if
a girl, to the left. Full of joy, spake the queen to her husband, “O lord, as the
living being which has entered within me clings to the right side, and will certainly
be a boy, therefore rejoice.”
</p>
<p>The king joyfully drew himself up, and stretched out his right arm, and said, “I shall
behold the son whom I have long been desiring. As he will soon be born unto me, he
will carry on my work, extend still more widely what has been acquired, and as my
heir more widely propagate my race. And when we shall have died, whether we have presented
many or few gifts and acquired much or little merit, it will follow after us in that
place in which we shall both be born again, and our recompense will ripen through
union.”
</p>
<p>Thus did he joyfully exclaim. As he knew that conception had taken place, he took
care, in order that the existence in the mother’s womb might be allowed to develop
thoroughly, that there should be in his palace during the cold weather preservatives
against cold, during the hot weather preservatives against heat. According to the
directions of the physician, he provided food which was not too bitter, too sour,
too salt, too sweet, too hot, or too acid—food which was without bitterness, sourness,
saltness, sweetness, heat, or acidity. With strings <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>of pearls of various kinds and with other ornaments he adorned the body of his wife,
like unto an Apsaras wandering in the Nandana grove; and he made seats and seats,
stools and stools, to prevent her from falling on the ground, and he ordered care
to be taken that she should not hear the slightest unpleasant noise.
</p>
<p>When eight or nine months had gone by, a boy was born of noble form and lovely aspect,
fair and gleaming like unto gold in colour, with a head like a canopy, long arms,
a brow of great width, interlacing eyebrows, a high-arched nose, and provided with
the full complement of limbs and joints. When the joy-drum was beaten at the birth,
the king heard it, and asked what that meant. His wives said, “Be of good cheer, your
majesty; unto thee a son is born.” Thereupon the king ordered all stones, gravel,
and rubble to be cast forth from the city, the streets to be swept and sprinkled with
sandal-water, standards and banners to be set up, extremely fragrant incense to be
provided, flowers to be strewed, as though he had been delighted by various dreams,
gifts to be bestowed upon the Śramaṇas, the Brahmans, the poor and the needy, and
freedom to be given to all prisoners. After thrice seven days, on the twenty-first
day, he appointed a great birth-feast. When the question was raised as to what name
should be given to the boy, the ministers said, “As this boy is the son of King Dhana,
he must be named Sudhana;” and so the name of Sudhana was given to him. The boy Sudhana
was handed over to eight nurses, two to carry him, two to suckle him, two to cleanse
him, and two to play with him. As these eight nurses fed him and brought him up on
milk, both sweet and curdled, on butter, both fresh and clarified, on butter-foam,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2175src" href="#xd31e2175">5</a> and on the best of other things, he shot up rapidly like a lotus in a tank. By the
time he was grown up he was acquainted with reading and writing, expert at the eight
testings and distinguishings, <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>and adroit in his manners; and he was skilled in the five arts, like a king who, coming
of the Kshatriya caste and wearing the crown, zealously exercises over men power and
might, and, if he rules over this orb, ought to be versed in the various divisions
of knowledge and action, as was above mentioned.
</p>
<p>His father bestowed upon him three wives—a first wife, a middle wife, and a last wife—and
built for his use three separate palaces, for winter, spring, and summer; and in like
manner he provided him with parks of three kinds, for winter, spring, and summer.
There the young Sudhana, when he went alone, without any retinue, into the upper storey
of the palace, diverted and enjoyed himself to the sound of musical instruments.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>It happened once that the hunter Phalaka, as he roamed to and fro in search after
game, arrived at a certain mountain, and at the foot of this mountain he perceived
a Rishi’s hermitage, rich in flowers and fruit. Around it fluttered birds of divers
kinds, and there was near it a lake provided with red and white lotuses, and with
geese and various kinds of ducks. As he was about to roam over this place of seclusion,
he saw a Rishi with long hair on his head and body, and with long nails and a long
beard, sitting in a grass hut under a tree. On seeing him he touched the Rishi’s feet
with his head, joined the palms of his hands, and said, “Venerable one, how long have
you been in this place?”
</p>
<p>“Forty years.”
</p>
<p>“While you have remained here, have you seen or heard anything strange or wonderful?”
</p>
<p>The Rishi, calm of mood, deliberately replied, “Friend, do you see that lake?”
</p>
<p>“Venerable one, I see it.”
</p>
<p>“That is the Brahmasabhā pool, filled with blue, red, and white lotuses, haunted by
swarms of different kinds of birds, extremely rich in waters resembling silver, snow,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>and hoarfrost in colour. To this pool in the midst of the most fragrant flowers, there
comes on the fifteenth day of the month Manoharā the daughter of Druma, the king of
the Kinnarīs. Surrounded by five hundred Kinnarīs, she comes in order to bathe, after
having washed and anointed her head. During the time of the bath they dance, sing,
and make sweet music resound, such as enchants even the beasts of the forest. Even
I myself, when I have heard these sounds, experience pleasure and delight for seven
whole days. This maiden, O friend, I have seen.”
</p>
<p>The hunter Phalaka said to himself, “As I have obtained the Amogha-chain from the
Nāga, I will cast it around the Kinnarī Manoharā.<span class="corr" id="xd31e2195" title="Not in source">”</span> He came, accordingly, after a time, on the fifteenth of the month, bringing the Amogha-chain
with him, concealed himself in a thicket not far from the lake, among fruits, flowers,
and foliage, and kept watch. When Manoharā, surrounded by five hundred Kinnarīs, with
befitting equipments, went into the Brahmasabhā lake to bathe, the hunter Phalaka
straightway cast the Amogha-chain, and caught the Kinnarī Manoharā. Held by the chain,
she began to bound and to run in the water and to utter shrieks of terror. Hearing
these, the Kinnarī band broke up. Looking upon Manoharā, the Kinnarīs saw that she
was taken prisoner, and they fled away terrified.
</p>
<p>The hunter gazed at Manoharā, who was of an exquisitely proportioned figure and of
a lovely countenance, and having gazed at her, he was about to draw near and lay hands
upon her; but she said, “Man of low station, touch me not. I am not destined to marry
you. As I am worthy of a king of goodly form, you must not lay hands upon me.” The
hunter said, “If I do not lay hands upon you you will flee away.” She replied, “I
will not flee away. If you will not trust me, take this head-jewel, by means of which
I fly heavenwards.” The hunter said, “Who can tell that?” She gave him the head-jewel
and said, “I <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>shall always be in the power of him whose hand holds this jewel.” The hunter took
the jewel, and led her away with him, just as if she had been secured by bonds.
</p>
<p>About this time the youth Sudhana went forth to the chase one day. The hunter saw
the youth Sudhana, who was handsome in form and of pleasant aspect; and having seen
him he said to himself, “As this is Prince Sudhana, and as he is of goodly form and
pleasant aspect, and as he, when he has looked upon this maiden, will take her to
wife, I will of my own accord offer her to him as a present.” So he led her, just
as if she had been secured by bonds, to Prince Sudhana, and said, after touching his
feet, “I offer unto you as a present this gem of a wife; be pleased to accept the
gift.” Prince Sudhana looked upon the Kinnarī Manoharā. She was of goodly form and
pleasing countenance, with a complexion of remarkable brilliance and with all good
properties, adorned with the eighteen signs of the woman, more beautiful than the
children of men; the breasts wide apart, and arched like the tortoise Hiraṇyakumbha,
firm, plump, extremely round and elastic; the eyes light blue, with small red veins
and of elongated form, like young lotuses; the arch of the nose long and high; the
lips like coral, gems, pearls, in form like the Bimba fruit; the chin ample and firm;
the cheeks marked by very attractive moles; the eyebrows beautifully interlacing,
black as a swarm of bees; the arms long and rounded like the spotless full moon; the
belly a little overhanging with three deep folds; the upper part of the body a little
bent from the down-hanging of the breasts, the under part beautifully formed like
a disk; the hands like unto the pith of the banana tree; the legs beautiful from their
delicacy and the rounding off of the calves; the veins scarcely visible and free from
all crookedness, so that all the limbs were fair to see, proudly moving to the sound
of the richly jewel-studded ornaments of the head, neck, and feet, and the many strings
of pearls; the hair black and smooth, like unto Sachī, the feet adorned with ornaments;
<span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>wearing a golden girdle, many strings of pearls hanging down at the belly, the complexion
gleaming fair as gold.
</p>
<p>No sooner had the youth set eyes on her than he was suddenly enchained by the bonds
of passion—passion which, like the pure and spotless moon reflected in water, is,
on account of its unstable nature, not easily to be grasped, and like a sea-monster
in a billowy torrent, is not easily to be distinguished, which steps along like the
Garuḍa or the flow of the wind, which flies about swiftly with a lightness resembling
that of cotton, which, like a monkey, is always in motion, never resting in any place.
When the arrow of passion, which is ever connected with woes and with longing to enjoy
the bliss of love, without letting itself be warned off from the abyss of misfortune
due to all those woes—when this arrow strikes the heart, shot from the careless bow
with a scarcely audible sound arising from the longing after a meeting, then, completely
befooled by senses which hang upon the fair one, a man falls, like a moth, into the
flame. As in summer the lightning flashes from out of the rain-cloud, so did the dart
of love strike Sudhana when he looked upon her whose countenance was like unto the
moon. Then Prince Sudhana took Manoharā and brought her to the city of Hastināpura,
and to the hunter he gave a splendid city. Ascending with Manoharā to the upper storey
of the palace, the youth Sudhana spent his time with her in pleasure and sport; and
by the hundredfold force of Manoharā’s youth, beauty, and respect for him, the youth
Sudhana was immediately and irresistibly captivated.
</p>
<p>After a time two Brahmans wandered that way, one of whom attached himself to the king,
the other to Sudhana. The Brahman who attached himself to the king was appointed a
Purohita<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2209src" href="#xd31e2209">6</a> by the king, who also bestowed much property upon him. But only a little <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>property was given to him who attached himself to Prince Sudhana. The prince’s Brahman
said to him, “O youth, what will you do for me when, after your father’s death, you
are made king?” The youth Sudhana replied, “As your companion has been appointed my
father’s Purohita, I will appoint you also to be a Purohita.” As this conversation
of theirs was passed on by one man to another, it came to the ears of the Brahman
who was the Purohita. He said to himself, “If I can manage so that the youth does
not acquire the sovereign power, there will no longer be any question as to the appointment
to the Purohitaship.”
</p>
<p>It came to pass afterwards that the mountaineers of the king’s realm rebelled. The
king sent a general to subdue them, but he returned completely overcome and vanquished.
Just the same happened to seven other generals whom the king sent out. The ministers
said to the king, “Wherefore, your majesty, do you allow your forces to dwindle away
and the power of the foe to increase? Be pleased to order out all who are capable
of bearing arms within your realm.” The Brahman who was the Purohita thought that
this was the time for bringing about Sudhana’s death, so he said to the king, “There
can be no doubt that in that wise defeat will take place.” The king said, “What am
I to do then? Ought I to march out myself?” The Purohita said, “Your majesty, why
should you go yourself? As the youth Sudhana has come to man’s estate, and is proud
of his strength and courage, you can send him out with the troops.” The king said,
“I will do so.” Thereupon the king summoned the youth, and said to him, “O youth,
march forth with the troops and subdue the mountaineers.” “Your majesty, I will act
in accordance with your commands.”
</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, Sudhana prepared to obey his father. On betaking himself to the
zenana, he saw Manoharā there, and not only forgot all his other wives, <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>but also, as soon as he saw her, forgot the commands laid upon him by the king. Thereupon
the Purohita said to the king, “Your majesty, as there can be no doubt that the youth
Sudhana is deeply in love with Manoharā, let the troops be drawn up, and order the
youth, when he comes forth from the zenana, to set out on the march without going
to see Manoharā again.” The king said to the ministers, “Honoured sirs, equip the
host.” The ministers obeyed the orders of the king, and equipped the hosts, elephants,
horses, chariots, and infantry, well provided with many kinds of weapons and appurtenances.
Then they summoned the youth, saying to him, “O youth, as the troops are ready, come
forth from thence.” He said, “Your majesty, I will go forth when I have seen Manoharā.”
</p>
<p>The king said, “O youth, do not go to see her, for that would give rise to delay.”
</p>
<p>“If that be so, I will set out when I have seen my mother.”
</p>
<p>“O youth, your mother you may see.”
</p>
<p>Sudhana took Manoharā’s head-jewel, went to his mother, touched her feet, and said,
“O mother, as I am setting out to subdue the mountaineers, do you keep this jewel
with the utmost secrecy, and do not give it to Manoharā except in a case of life and
death.” After saying these words to his mother, and taking leave of her, he set forth
with the army to the sound of music. After gradually advancing for some time, he halted
under a tree at no great distance from the mountaineers. Just at that time the Mahārāja
Vaiśravaṇa was going to a Yaksha meeting, together with many Yakshas, many hundreds,
many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of Yakshas. As he drove along, and was
delayed upon the celestial road, he said to himself, “Often as I have driven along
this road, yet has my chariot never once been delayed. What can be the cause of its
being delayed now?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>Perceiving the youth Sudhana, he thought, “This is a Bodisat of the Bhadrakalpa, who
has gone forth to war and will be in difficulty. I will assist him, and subdue the
mountaineers without living creatures being exposed to danger.” So he summoned Pānchika,
the commander-in-chief of the Yakshas, and said to him, “Pānchika, come here. Contrive
so that the youth Sudhana may subdue the mountaineers without a battle being fought
or injury being inflicted upon living creatures.” The Yaksha commander-in-chief Pānchika
listened to the orders of Vaiśravaṇa, and said, “I will act in accordance with your
commands.” Then he conjured up the four contingents of the divine host, men of the
stature of palm trees, elephants of the size of mountains, horses as large as elephants,
and chariots as bulky as the palace of the gods Vimāna. Together with his mighty host,
spreading great alarm by means of all kinds of weapons, such as swords, mallets, javelins,
lances, disks, maces, arrows, battle-axes, and so forth, and through the clang of
all sorts of musical instruments, Pānchika moved onwards towards the mountaineers,
whose walls gave way in consequence of the uproar made by the elephants, the horses,
and the chariots, and of the clangings of all kinds, and of the power of the Yakshas.
Seeing these hosts, and perceiving that their walls had given way, the mountaineers
were greatly astonished, and asked the hosts whence they came. They replied, “Open
the gates with all speed. The youth Sudhana is on the march behind us, and we are
his army. If you do not open your gates with all speed, everything will be overthrown.”
The mountaineers said, “We did not rebel against the king. Moreover, the youth is
judicious; but we have been reduced to fear and anxiety by the king’s officials.”
Then they opened the gates, and went forth to meet the youth Sudhana, with banners
and standards displayed, with full urns, and to the sound of all manner of instruments.
After he had taken rest, he called them to him, nominated chiefs, <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>fixed taxes, and took hostages. Then, having subdued the mountaineers, the youth Sudhana
returned home.
</p>
<p>That same night King Dhana dreamt this dream. A vulture came flying up, tore open
the king’s belly, seized his entrails, and wound them around the whole city. And the
seven treasures came into the palace. Terrified by this dream, with creeping skin
and unquiet mind, he rose swiftly from his couch, and sat down in his sleeping chamber,
his head leaning on his hand, absorbed in meditation as to whether he was about to
lose his sovereign power or whether he was about to die. In the morning he told his
dream to the Purohita, who came to the conclusion that, as the king had dreamt such
a dream, the youth must certainly have subdued the mountaineers, and that it was the
Purohita’s business to devise some means for his destruction, so he said to the king,
“What your majesty has seen in this dream is not good. There is no doubt that either
you will lose your sovereignty, or your life will be placed in danger. There is, however,
a means of averting this evil. I have found it in the mystic lore of the Brahmans.”
“What is the means of averting it?” “Your majesty, let a tank be dug in the park,
a man’s height in depth, and let it be lined with mortar, and when all is smooth,
let it be filled with the blood of young roes. Then, when you go there to bathe, you
will enter the tank as far as the first step, and when you have descended to the first
step you will go down to the second step, and after you have descended to the second
step you will go on to the third step, and when you have descended to the third step
you will go down to the fourth step. Then must four Brahmans, perfectly versed in
the Veda and Vedānga, lick your feet with their tongues, and anoint them with the
fat of a non-human being (<i>i.e.</i>, a demon). In this wise will all that is sinful in your nature become purified, and
you will long retain your sovereignty.” The king said, “All this may possibly be carried
out, but yet demon-fat is very rare.” The Purohita <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>said, “Your majesty, is that a rarity which it is possible to find?” The king said,
“What does that mean?” The Purohita said, “Your majesty, is Manoharā a human or a
non-human being?” The king said, “O Purohita, speak not so; for the youth’s life depends
upon her.” The Purohita said, “Your majesty, have you not heard that for the sake
of the house should one of its inmates be given up, for the sake of the city should
the house be given up, for the sake of the country should the city be given up, for
the sake of one’s own self should the country be given up?<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2236src" href="#xd31e2236">7</a> If you, O king, are firm, you can bestow another wife on the discerning youth, and
cause Manoharā to be put to death.”
</p>
<p>As the king, out of self-love, did not wish any means to be neglected, he acquiesced
and ordered the preparations to be made according to the Purohita’s directions, the
tank to be dug, lined with mortar and glazed, and filled with the blood of roes and
so forth. When Sudhana’s wives saw these preparations, cheerfulness and joy sprang
up within them. “As we also,” they said, “shall acquire exquisite beauty if we avail
ourselves of this, we shall be able to partake of great enjoyment with the youth Sudhana.”
As they spoke joyfully to this effect, Manoharā saw them, and asked wherefore they
were so delighted. One of them explained the whole matter to Manoharā. Thereupon pain
and displeasure sprang up within her, and she betook herself to Sudhana’s mother,
and touched her feet, and told her the whole story in words provocative of sympathy.
The queen said, “As these things are so, ponder over them well, and I will ponder
over them also.”
</p>
<p>When Manoharā had reflected and spoken, and the queen also had considered the matter,
and had decided that it was right so to do, she gave Manoharā the head-jewel and a
garment, and said, “Child, I was to give you this jewel only if your life was in danger.
In the present circumstances I shall be beyond reproach.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>After a time, all things having been prepared for the bath according to the command
of the king, he entered the blood-filled tank and came forth from it again, and then
the Brahmans licked his feet with their tongues. When, subsequently to this, all things
had been set in order for the bath according to the commands of the king, and he had
entered the blood-filled tank and emerged from it again, then the tongues of the Brahmans
licked his feet. After that the supernatural being was brought forward. When Manoharā
was ordered to draw nearer, she immediately rose heavenwards, saying, “After being
seized and bound, after having laughed and played, like a cow freed from its bonds,
will I flee away.” When the king saw her sweeping through the air, fear came upon
him, and he said to the Purohita, “How comes it that the Kinnarī Manoharā has flown
away before our preparations were carried into effect?” The Purohita said, “Your majesty,
the end is now attained, and your nature is made free from sin.”
</p>
<p>While Manoharā was wending her way through the air she said to herself, “The directions
of the Rishi were the cause of my passing into this condition. Had he not given these
directions I should not have been captured. So I will go to him for awhile.” On reaching
the Rishi’s hermitage she touched his feet and said, “Great Rishi, in consequence
of your directions, I have been captured and exposed to the touch of man, and have
nearly lost my life. Now then, if the youth Sudhana should happen to come here in
search of me, give him my ring, and say to him these words: ‘O youth, turn back again,
for the way is full of woe and hard to tread. But if you cannot turn back, it is right
to show you the way. Thus, O youth, does Manoharā point it out. In the north there
are three black mountains. When these are surmounted, there rise three more. When
these three have been surmounted, there rise three more again. And when these three
also have been surmounted, there remains the prince of mountains, <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>Himavant. On its north side are the mountains Utkīlaka, Jalapatha, Khadiraka, Ekadāraka,
Vajraka, Kāmarūpin, Kīlaka, Airāvata, Adhovāna, and Pramuchapa. Over these mountains
you must make your way. Traverse Khadiraka, Ekadāraka, and Utkīlaka by the cavern.
The king of the birds will carry you over Vajraka. In such a way will you traverse
these mountains. You will overcome magic creatures, ram-like and goat-faced, and also
a man having the form of the Rākshasa Pingalā. In the cavern is a huge snake, which
rolls with the force of a foaming stream. This snake you must tame by force. When
you see the black snake half coiling in the cavern, you must slay it, bending the
bow and shooting the arrow. When you see two rams butting one another, break a horn
off each of them, and you will find the way. If you see two iron men with fear-inspiring
weapons, and you slay one of them, you will find the way. If you see an iron-lipped
Rākshasī opening and shutting her mouth, you must fling a wedge at her forehead. Likewise
must you spring across the fount with the wild whirlpool, which measures sixty fathoms.
Bending your bow, you must slay Yakshas and Rākshasas with lion-yellow hair and eyes,
difficult to resist and hard to approach. Many rivers, also, full of tens of thousands
of alligators, must you cross. You will see the Crocodile, the Butterfly, the Sad,
the Gay, the Weeper, the Laugher, a river full of snakes, and another full of reeds.
In the Crocodile is Rākshasī-anger, in the Butterfly a demon, in the Sad are many
water-monsters, in the Gay is a Vidyādhara, in the Weeper is a Kinnarī serving-maid,
in the Laugher is a Kinnarī, in the snake-filled river are many snakes, in the river
rich in reeds is Śālmali [the Seemul or silk-cotton tree]. In the presence of the
Crocodile [river] you must stand firm, and be bold in that of the Butterfly. On reaching
the Sad, you must bind the jaws of the water-monsters. With the Gay you will succeed
by the help of some Nāgas, with the Weeper by means of courage, with the Laugher by
means of silence. <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>The snake-filled river you must pass by means of snake-charms, and the reed-producing
river by means of the charm of sharp weapons beaten together.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2253src" href="#xd31e2253">8</a> Having crossed all the rivers, you will come to a wild country wherein five hundred
Yakshas dwell. Opposing these, overcome them. Then will appear the capital of the
Kinnarī king. To him address yourself.’ ” Having spoken these words to the Rishi,
Manoharā touched his feet with her head and went away.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Great was the joy when the king heard that the youth Sudhana had returned to Hastināpura
with the army after subduing the mountaineers. As soon as the youth had rested, he
went to his father, made obeisance, and took his place before him. The king began
to speak with great joy, and said, “O youth, have you been successful?”
</p>
<p>“Your majesty, through your grace have the mountaineers been overcome, hostages have
been taken, and chiefs appointed. Tribute and taxes have also been levied. Be pleased
to have all this taken into the treasury.”
</p>
<p>The king said, “O son, as you have done well, I will receive these things.” Then the
son made obeisance to his father, and was about to depart when the king said, “Stay,
O youth, in order to take food with your father.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Your majesty, as it is a long time since I saw Manoharā, I wish to go to her.”
</p>
<p>“O youth, put off going to her for to-day and go to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>“Father, I will certainly go to-day,” said the youth, moving restlessly this way and
that. Whereupon the king made no reply.
</p>
<p>When the youth entered his house, and did not see the fair one at the door of the
women’s chamber, he was utterly cast down. As he did not see Manoharā, his mind became
disordered, and he ran hither and thither, calling out, “Manoharā! Manoharā!” When
the women had repeated these words to the winds, and he in his grief of heart had
many times questioned them, they told him the whole story. Clouded over was his mind
with grief. The women said, “Why should you be so cast down? In the band of women
are those who are much more beautiful than she was.”
</p>
<p>When he had learnt how cruelly his father had acted, he went to his mother, touched
her feet, and said, “O mother, as Manoharā is not here, Manoharā who was endowed with
every virtue that could be wished for, and endowed with admirable beauty, where then
has she gone? Thinking ever so rapidly, I am all confused in mind. On account of being
separated from her my mind is exceedingly sad. As Manoharā dwells within my mind,
pleasing to my mind and my mind’s joy, as through separation from Manoharā my body
is saddened, what is there that will make my pain diminish?” His mother said, “O son,
as intolerable fear came upon Manoharā, I let her go away.” “Mother, how did that
come to pass?” His mother gave him a complete account of the matter. He said, “That
was a cruel misdeed on my father’s part.” He said, moreover, “Mother, whither has
she gone? which way lies the road?” His mother replied, “The road which Manoharā has
taken is that of the mountains where Rishis and lions ever dwell, and which are the
abode of the Dharma-rāja.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2276src" href="#xd31e2276">9</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>In his intolerable grief at being separated from Manoharā, the prince renewed his
sad wailings, crying, “As Manoharā is not here, Manoharā who was endowed with every
virtue that could be desired,” and so on down to the words, “What is there that will
make my pain diminish?” Then his mother said, “My son, as there are women in this
band of wives who are more beautiful than she is, wherefore are you sad?” The youth
replied, “Mother, how can I be happy if I find her not?”
</p>
<p>Although his mother tried to console him, he still remained sad; but as he wandered
hither and thither, looking for Manoharā and seeking for information as to her abode,
a bright idea occurred to him. “Where I obtained her,” he thought, “there will I go
again and make inquiries.” So he went to the hunter Phalaka, and asked him where it
was that he had got possession of Manoharā. The hunter replied, “On the slope of such
and such a mountain dwells a Rishi, in whose hermitage there is a pool, Brahmasabhā
by name. Going there to bathe, I captured her according to the Rishi’s directions.”
Sudhana said to himself, “I will go to the Rishi’s abode, and there obtain information.”
Hearing that the youth was greatly depressed by his separation from Manoharā, the
king said, “O youth, wherefore are you so depressed? I will now give you a much more
beautiful wife.” The prince replied, “Father, as she is not here, I shall certainly
betake me to her tarrying-place.” The king could not dissuade him from this, though
he repeatedly attempted to do so. Then the king ordered watchers to be set at the
gates and outlets from the walls, in order to prevent the youth from going forth.
Thereupon the youth could not sleep the whole night long. Five are there who on their
nightly couch are sleepless all night long, namely, the man whose mind is enchained
by love for his wife, the wife who loves her husband, the red duck, the robber chieftain,
the Bhikshu who studies zealously. The youth <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>said to himself, “If I go to the gate, the king’s gatekeepers are harsh. As they would
punish me, or even deprive me of life, I would rather depart by a road which has no
watchers.” So he went forth by night to a spot where no watcher was, having attached
to a standard such blue lotus garlands as men bind around their heads. Just then the
moon rose. When he saw the moon, he uttered this lament for his separation from Manoharā,
“O full moon, king of the stars and illuminer of the night, thou who art dear to the
eye of Rohiṇī,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2285src" href="#xd31e2285">10</a> excellent caravan-leader, hast thou seen the abiding-place of my loved one, the lotus-eyed
Manoharā?”
</p>
<p>Remembering the joys he had formerly experienced, he walked on, and when he saw a
gazelle, he addressed it also, saying, “O gazelle, thou who enjoyest grass, water,
and foliage, wander in peace and quiet, for I am no hunter. Hast not thou seen my
deer-like, long-eyed, beautifully formed Manoharā?” Going on farther, and reaching
another spot, he saw bees at work in the interior of a wood adorned with flowers and
fruits, and to one of the bees he said, “O bee, thou who art blue, like unto the mountains,
thou who abidest within hollow canes and upon lotuses, hast thou seen my Manoharā,
her of the long hair, dark of hue, like unto bees?” Going still farther he saw a snake,
and when he saw it he said, “O snake, thou who movest thy tongue as a forest tree
its leaves, thou who emittest from thy mouth and eyes masses of smoke, hast thou seen
her who is unlike thy poison-fire and the fire of passion? hast thou seen my Manoharā?”
He went on still farther, and he heard a Kokila calling in the forest, and seeing
it, he said, “O Kokila, thou who abidest on the magnificent trees of the forest, king
of the troops of birds, hast not thou seen her who is endowed with the lovely, spotless
eyes, like unto <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>blue lotuses? hast not thou seen my Manoharā?” Going still farther on, he saw an Aśoka
tree widely spreading forth its leaves, and when he saw it he said, “Thou who art
called after happiness,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2294src" href="#xd31e2294">11</a> and who art the great king of the trees, troubled by grief for Manoharā, I clasp
my hands. Do thou dispel my grief.”
</p>
<p>After this fashion, with troubled mind, he at length arrived at the hermitage of the
Rishi. And when he had meekly paid reverence to the Rishi, he said, “O thou who art
exalted through endurance, thou who art clothed in the bark of trees and the skins
of wild beasts, thou who feedest on roots and sprouts, the Vilva tree and the Kapittha
tree.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2301src" href="#xd31e2301">12</a> O Rishi, I pay thee reverence, bowing my head. Hast thou seen my Manoharā? Tell me
quickly.” Then the Rishi said to the youth Sudhana, “Welcome!” And after unfolding
a carpet and making preparations for a friendly reception, he continued, “I have seen
her who is endowed with smooth, interlacing eyebrows, who possesses a comely form,
a face resembling the full moon, and eyes like unto blue lotuses. Take your seat upon
the carpet, and partake of these different kinds of roots and berries. There is no
doubt in my mind that you will obtain happiness in the future. Thus spake she of the
beautiful eyebrows: ‘I have learnt that the youth, rendered unhappy by longing, although
a dweller in the forest, affected by great sorrow, will come to you.’ Then she gave
me this ring and said, ‘As the way which leads to me is full of woe and hard to tread,
he can turn back. But if he cannot bring himself to turn back, then you must direct
him on his way.’ And she spoke as follows: ‘In the north there are three black mountains.
When these are surmounted, there are three more on the other side; and when these
three have been surmounted, <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>there are again three more; and when these three also have been surmounted, there
remains the king of mountains, Himavant. Here are certain remedies to be obtained.
There is the remedy nectar.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2310src" href="#xd31e2310">13</a> When it has been boiled in melted butter, he who drinks it will feel neither hunger
nor thirst, and will increase in memory and strength. There is also a monkey which
must be carried away; there are spells which must be learnt; and there are also to
be carried away a bow and arrows, a gleaming jewel, a deadly poison and a remedy,
three iron wedges, and a lyre. On the north side of Himavant, king of mountains, is
Mount Utkīlaka, and beyond are Mounts Jalapatha, Khadiraka, Ekadāraka, Vajraka, Kāmarūpin,
Utkīlaka, Airāvata, Adhovāna, and Pramuchaka. These mountains you must climb, but
to pass Khadiraka, Ekadāraka, and Utkīlaka you must traverse a cavern, and over Vajraka
will the king of the birds convey you. In this way will you cross the mountains. Magic
creatures, ram-like and goat-faced, and a man who has the form of the Rākshasa Pingalā,
you must overcome. In the cavern is a snake which rolls with the strength of a foaming
stream, and this you must overcome by force. Where there is a black snake, and you
see half of it in the cavern, you must bend your bow and let fly your arrow and kill
it. When you see two rams butting one another, break a horn off each of them and you
will find your way. When you see two iron men holding fear-inspiring weapons, strike
down one of them and you will find your way. When you see a Rākshasī with iron lips
opening and shutting her mouth, fling a wedge at her forehead. Then you must leap
across the fount with the wild whirlpool, which measures sixty fathoms. You must bend
your bow and slay Yakshas and Rākshasas with lion-yellow hair and eyes, difficult
to resist and hard to approach. Many rivers, also, filled with alligators, must you
cross. There are the Crocodile, the Butterfly, the Sad, the Gay, <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>the Weeper, the Laugher, a river full of snakes, and a river rich in reeds. In the
Crocodile is Rākshasī-anger, in the Butterfly is a demon, in the Sad are many water-monsters,
in the Gay is a Vidyādhara, in the Weeper a Kinnarī serving-maid, in the Laugher is
a Kinnarī, in the snake-filled river are many snakes, in the river rich in reeds is
Śālmali. In the presence of the Crocodile you must stand firm, and you must be bold
in the presence of the Butterfly. On reaching the Sad, you must bind the jaws of the
water-monsters. With the Gay you will succeed by the help of some Nāgas, with the
Weeper by means of courage, with the Laugher by means of silence. You will cross the
snake-filled river by means of the charm against snakes, and the river rich in reeds
by means of the magic of sharp weapons struck together. When you have crossed the
rivers and reached a land rich in bushes, you must oppose and overcome five hundred
Yakshas who dwell there. There stands the capital of the Kinnarī king. Go and speak
with him.’ ”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the youth Sudhana touched the Rishi’s feet with his head, and went away
in order to seek the remedies, spells, and antidotes indicated to him. When he had
obtained all but the monkey, he came back with them to the Rishi. The Rishi gave him
a monkey and said, “O youth, why do you trouble yourself so much? Wherefore is Manoharā
so necessary to you. Alone, without companions, you will surely lose your life.” The
youth replied, “Great Rishi, I shall surely go, and why? Where has the heaven-traversing
moon a companion? The king of the beasts, endowed with strength of tusks, and the
fire which burns the forest—where are their companions? Wherefore should a strength
like mine require a companion? What! shall not men trust themselves to the great ocean
wave? Shall not one heal the hand which a snake has bitten? If a vigorous being struggles
to the utmost, no blame can be found with the pains taken, even though they may not
be successful.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon the youth Sudhana, provided with the various objects indicated by Manoharā,
set forth. He passed in their turn the rivers, the caverns, and the abysses, assisted
by the remedies, the spells, and the antidotes, and he came into the neighbourhood
of the Kinnarī king, Druma. The youth gazed at the city, which was adorned by a park
rich in flowers and fruits of various kinds, the haunt of all sorts of birds, provided
with tanks, oblong and square lakes, and surrounded by Kinnarīs. He saw some Kinnarīs
coming to draw water, and he said to them, “What are you going to do with all that
water?” They replied, “The Kinnarī king has a daughter, Manoharā. As she has fallen
into the hands of human beings, the smell of humanity has to be washed off her.” The
youth Sudhana said, “Are all these jugs to be emptied over her at once, or one after
another?” They replied, “One after another.” He thought, “Here is a good opportunity.
I will drop this ring into one of the jugs.” He chose the jug of one of the Kinnarīs,
dropped the ring into it, and said to her, “Let your jug be the first to begin Manoharā’s
ablutions.” Whereupon she thought, “No doubt he will be wanting something or other.”
</p>
<p>When this Kinnarī had been the first to empty her jug over Manoharā’s head, the ring
fell into Manoharā’s lap, who said to her, “Has not a man come hither?” She replied,
“Yes.” “Go to him, and bring him to some retired spot.” Accordingly the Kinnarī brought
him in and took him to a retired spot. Then Manoharā touched her father’s feet and
said, “Father, if the youth Sudhana, who was my husband, were to come here, what would
you do with him?” He replied, “As he is a man, and I have no need of him, I would
cut him into a hundred pieces and scatter him on all four sides.” Manoharā said, “Father,
as he is a man, how could he be here? It was only my talk.”
</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the wrath of the Kinnarī king, Druma, was assuaged, he said, “If
the youth comes, I <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>will have you provided with all kinds of ornaments, and with many goods and treasures,
and surrounded by Kinnarīs, and will give you to him as his wife.” Thereupon Manoharā,
full of great delight, clothed the youth Sudhana in divine array, and showed him to
the Kinnarī king, Druma. When the Kinnarī king, Druma, saw the young Sudhana’s stately
form and pleasing aspect, his handsome face and brilliant complexion, he was greatly
astonished. As he was desirous of having him as his son-in-law, he set in order seven
golden stems, seven palms, seven kettledrums, and seven wild boars. Now the youth
Sudhana was a Bodisat, and Bodisats are versed in all arts and in every kind of skill.
Moreover, the gods take pains to remove all hindrances out of their way. The Bodisat
stepped forth, surrounded by many thousands of Kinnarīs, amid dance and song, and
to the sound of the harps, kettledrums, cymbals, lutes, drums, and the rest of the
instruments of various kinds made by the gods. Before the eyes of the Kinnarī king,
Druma, he drew nigh to the golden stems, wielding a sword which looked like the leaf
of a blue lotus, and began to cut the stems in pieces as though he were slicing a
plantain. Whereupon he broke them into fragments like grains of sesame. Moreover he
shot an arrow uninjured through the seven palm-trees, the seven kettledrums, and the
seven boars, and remained standing like Sumeru unremoved. Thereupon the heaven-inhabiting
gods and many hundreds of thousands of Kinnarīs set up a cry of triumph with noise
and shouting. When the Kinnarī king, Druma, saw and heard all this, he marvelled greatly.
</p>
<p>After that the king placed Manoharā in the middle of a thousand Kinnarīs exactly like
her, and said to the youth Sudhana, “Come hither, O youth, and recognise Manoharā.”
Then the youth Sudhana, in order that he might recognise her, uttered these verses,
“Thou who art Drama’s daughter, thou art also my beloved Manoharā; let it come to
pass, in consequence of this truth, that thou, O <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>Manoharā, swiftly steppest to the front.” Thereupon she immediately stepped forward,
and the Kinnarīs said, “Your majesty, as this youth Sudhana is of excellent strength,
manliness, and courage, and deserves to be Manoharā’s husband, therefore please to
be angry no longer, and to give Manoharā to him.”
</p>
<p>Then the Kinnarī king summoned the Kinnarī host, and the Kinnarī assembly paid great
honour to the youth Sudhana. Holding Manoharā adorned with divine array with his left
hand, and a jar full of gold-dust with his right hand, the king went up to the youth
Sudhana and said, “O youth, I give you Manoharā as your wife, surrounded by a thousand
<span class="corr" id="xd31e2330" title="Source: Kīnnarīs">Kinnarīs</span>. But men are of a fickle nature. Do not on any account desert her.” “I will act,
O father, in accordance with your words,” said the youth Sudhana, and proffered obedience
to the Kinnarī king, Druma. Then in a palace of the Kinnarī domain he and Manoharā,
apart from men, revelled and enjoyed themselves to the sound of the musical instruments.
</p>
<p>After a time, remembering his home, and being depressed by the pain arising from his
separation from his parents, he informed Manoharā that he was overcome by the anguish
caused by his separation from his parents. Thereupon Manoharā gave her father a full
account of what had taken place. The king said, “Go with the youth, but act cautiously,
seeing that men are deceitful.” Then the Kinnarī king, Druma, let her go, after bestowing
upon her jewels, pearls, gold and so forth in profusion.
</p>
<p>Sudhana went his way with Manoharā, speeding onwards through the air by Kinnarī power,
and at length arrived at the city of Hastināpura. In the city of Hastināpura, after
all stones, gravel, and rubble had been swept away, and sandal-wood water had been
sprinkled, and floral hangings, standards, and flags had been set up, and exceedingly
fragrant incense had been provided, and flowers of all sorts had been strewn about,
men gave <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>themselves up to rejoicing. Then the youth, accompanied by Manoharā, surrounded by
many thousands of leaders of men, made his entry into the city of Hastināpura.
</p>
<p>When he had recovered from the fatigue caused by the journey, he took jewels of different
kinds and went to his father, and remained standing beside the king, and gave him
a full account of his journey to and from the Kinnarī city. As King Dhana had become
aware that the prince possessed remarkable strength, manliness, and courage, he invested
him with regal power. The youth Sudhana said to himself, “That I have met with Manoharā
and obtained the might of kingly power is the special result of earlier deeds. Therefore
will I now also bestow gifts and practise virtuous works.”
</p>
<p>And during the space of twelve years he without let or hindrance offered sacrifice
in the city of Hastināpura.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Videha, in a vast, rich, prosperous, fruitful, and populous land, reigned King
Virūḍhaka. He had five hundred ministers, with Śakala at their head, and through his
chief minister Śakala he ruled in accordance with the law, and transacted business
according to justice. For this reason all men looked up to Śakala. After Śakala had
taken to himself a wife of his own degree, and had lived with her, there was born
unto him a son, to whom, on the twenty-first day after his birth, the name of Gopāla
was given. After he had again lived with his wife, another son was born to him, to
whom he gave the name of Sim̃ha.
</p>
<p>When these two sons were grown up, it was with them just as it had been with their
father, who from the very first surpassed all the other ministers in courage and superiority
in the five arts. Now these ministers could not endure this. So they took counsel
together, and betook themselves to the king, and asked him, when an opportunity presented
itself, who really was king. The king replied, “Honoured sirs, what is the meaning
of such a question? I am the king. Who else could there be?” They said, “O king, Śakala
is king, not you. If he could manage it, he would deprive you of the regal power,
set the diadem on his own head, and seize the regal power for himself.” But the king
saw quite clearly that they were hostile to Śakala because he was superior to them
all.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>On another occasion, the king was sitting surrounded by the band of ministers, while
the first minister, Śakala, was detained in the king’s palace, surrounded by eight
thousand plaintiffs and defendants, so that the king’s palace was quite full. But
when the public business was brought to an end and the crowd had gone away, the palace
was left quite empty. The king asked if all the crowd had left the palace. The ministers,
trusting that they had found an opportunity, replied, “O king, what you wished to
hear is evidently this: If Śakala could bring it about, he would deprive you of the
sovereignty, set the diadem upon his own head, and seize the regal power for himself.”
</p>
<p>As kings, like crows, live in fear of death, he thought that what they said was doubtless
true, and he began to find fault with Śakala. As every one finds in the world friends,
foes, and indifferent persons, Śakala’s attention began to be called to the fact that
the king wanted to get up a quarrel with him, and that he must therefore take some
precautions. After pondering over the matter, he considered whither he should betake
himself. If he were to go to Śrāvastī, he would be in the same danger there, as that
also was under regal power. Just the same would be the case if he were to go to Vārāṇasī,
to Rājagṛha, or to Champā. Only in Vaiśālī did the people rule. There, if ten men
were contented, twenty were discontented. He had better betake himself thither.
</p>
<p>So he sent a messenger to the Liććhavis<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2363src" href="#xd31e2363">2</a> of Vaiśālī to ask if he might take up his abode under the shelter of their power.
They replied with all respect that he might come to Vaiśālī, and would be welcome
there. Thereupon the first minister, Śakala, called his kinsmen together, and said
to them, “Honoured sirs, I am about to move to Vaiśālī. Let those among you who are
contented here remain here; but he who is not so, let him get ready <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>and go with me.” He also ordered the herdsmen to drive the oxen and buffaloes to Vaiśālī,
and told his servants to get themselves ready for the journey thither.
</p>
<p>After having thus incited many men to get ready, he went to the king, touched his
two feet, and said, “O king, as I have a little business to see to, allow me to go
to the park.” The king gave his consent. When Śakala had caused the park to be ransacked,
he filled his waggons with treasures, which he covered over with food and liquor,
and set off.
</p>
<p>When the ministers heard that Śakala had absconded, they came in haste to the king
and reported his flight. The king ordered them to recall him. They equipped a fourfold
army, overtook him, and ordered him to turn back in compliance with the king’s commands.
He replied, “Honoured sirs, ye have long been considering whether I should die or
take to flight. As the latter has now come to pass without much difficulty, think
no more of it. I have escaped.”
</p>
<p>They shot some arrows in order to satisfy the king’s expectations. Then they turned
back and informed the king that Śakala had escaped. The king was displeased thereat
and kept silence.
</p>
<p>At that time there were three districts in Vaiśālī. In the first district were 7000
houses<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2373src" href="#xd31e2373">3</a> with golden towers, in the middle district were 14,000 houses with silver towers,
and in the last district were 21,000 houses with copper towers. In these lived the
upper, the middle, and the lower classes, according to their position. The people
of Vaiśālī had made a law that a daughter born in the first district could marry only
in the first district, not in the second or third; that one born in the middle district
could marry only in the first and second; but that one born in the last district could
marry in any one of the three; moreover, that no marriage was to be contracted outside
Vaiśālī, and that a woman recognised as a pearl <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>among women should not be married to any one, but should appertain to the people for
common enjoyment.
</p>
<p>As Śakala was a man of position, he was allotted a house in the first district. When
he began to live there, he could not be induced, although invited, to appear in the
assembly of the people. The Liććhavis asked him why he did not appear. He replied,
“As harm might come to me from the assembly, therefore I do not go to it.” The inhabitants
of Vaiśālī encouraged him to attend, saying that no harm could come to him. He then
went to the assembly, but he never expressed any opinion. They invited him to do so.
But he explained that he never did so, because if he did some evil might come upon
him. They declared that he ought to do so, and that doing so would bring him into
no trouble. So when he afterwards appeared in the public assembly, he expressed his
opinion along with the rest.
</p>
<p>Up to that time, the Liććhavis of Vaiśālī, whenever they sent a missive to any one,
wrote it in a rude style. But after Śakala had given his advice they framed their
missives in a friendly tone. They who received such friendly missives talked them
over among themselves, and tried to find out the reason for this friendliness. Then
some of them explained that it was since Śakala, the first minister of Virūḍhaka,
king of Videha, came to Vaiśālī and took part in the councils, that letters of this
kind, full of friendliness, had been issued.
</p>
<p>After Śakala had arranged marriages for his two sons, Gopāla and Sim̃ha, there was
born unto Sim̃ha a daughter, to whom the name of Vāsavī was given at her birth-feast.
When the seers had inspected her, they declared that she would bear a son who would
take his father’s life, set the diadem on his own head, and seize the sovereignty
for himself. After Sim̃ha had again lived with his wife, a daughter was born to him,
whose birth also was celebrated in the most festive manner, and to whom the name of
Upavāsavī was given. Her also the seers inspected, <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>and they declared that she would bring into the world a son provided with excellent
qualities.
</p>
<p>Now it came to pass that Gopāla, who was fierce and of great strength, ravaged the
parks of the Liććhavis of Vaiśālī. The park-keepers tried to prevent him from doing
so, pointing out to him that the Liććhavis were fierce and of great power. As the
keepers gained nothing thereby, they betook themselves to his father and besought
him to restrain his son. Śakala sent for him, and made him aware of the danger which
threatened him on the part of the Liććhavis. He replied, “Father, they have parks;
we have none.” Śakala said that he would ask the popular assembly for a park. He did
so, and the assembly granted them an old park. In the park there was an ancient Sāla
tree, out of which the one made an image of Bhagavant, and the other consecrated the
same. The Sthaviras in the Sūtras also say that the Buddha Bhagavant went out from
Vaiśālī into the Sāla forest of Gopāla and Sim̃ha.
</p>
<p>When Gopāla had committed a thousand misdeeds, and the Liććhavis had blamed and reproved
him and called him to account, Śakala sent for him, and commanded him, in order not
to irritate the people, to retire to a certain hill district, and there to practise
agriculture on his own lands. The son obeyed his father’s commands.
</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the commander of Vaiśālī died, the first minister, Śakala, was elected
commander. After he had held this post for a short time, he also died. The people
of Vaiśālī met together, and held counsel as to whom they should appoint commander.
Then some of them said, “As the excellent minister, Śakala, has admirably protected
the people, let us elect his son.” Others said, “His son Gopāla is fierce and of great
strength. If we appoint him as commander, discord will be sure to come upon the people.
His younger brother, Sim̃ha, is good, accessible, and likely to render the people
contented. If it so please the people, let us appoint him commander.” As all acquiesced
in this, the assembly waited upon Sim̃ha <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>and offered him the post of commander. He answered, “Gopāla is my elder brother; therefore
appoint him.” They replied, “O Sim̃ha, is the post of commander hereditary in your
family? If you are not inclined to take the post, we will appoint some one else commander.”
He reflected that it would not be well if the commandership were to pass to some other
family from his own, so he decided that it would be better to accept it. Thereupon
he was invested with the office in great state.
</p>
<p>Previously to this, when the inhabitants of Vaiśālī sent a missive, they used to write,
“Thus say the people, with Śakala at their head.” A little after this a missive arrived
at the place where Gopāla was practising agriculture on his lands. When Gopāla had
opened it and perused it, he asked if his father was dead, seeing that the inhabitants
of Vaiśālī had been in the habit of writing, “Thus say the people, with Śakala at
their head,” but now there was written, “Thus say the people, with Sim̃ha at their
head.” When he was told that his father was dead, he took offence, and went to <span class="corr" id="xd31e2393" title="Source: Vaisālī">Vaiśālī</span>, and asked Sim̃ha if it was right that he should have been made commander, although
he himself, Gopāla, was the elder brother. Sim̃ha explained how the whole matter had
come about. Full of displeasure against the Liććhavis, Gopāla determined, in consequence
of this slight, to go to Rājagṛha. So he sent a messenger to King Bimbisāra to make
known his desire to place himself under the king’s protection. The king sent back
word that he would be welcome. So he went to Rājagṛha, and King Bimbisāra made him
his first minister.
</p>
<p>Now after some time King Bimbisāra’s chief wife died, and as he was sitting depressed,
leaning his cheek upon his hand, Gopāla asked him what was the cause of his grief.
He replied that his chief wife was dead, and he could not but be unhappy. Gopāla said,
“O king, be not troubled in mind. My younger brother has two daughters, perfect in
youth and beauty. They would be <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>exactly suitable for you. One of them, according to predictions, will give birth to
a son who will put his father to death. But the other will bring into the world a
son possessing the most excellent characteristics. It will be well for you, O king,
to have that maiden brought here, of whom it was predicted that she would bear a son
with the most excellent characteristics.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Gopāla informed his brother Sim̃ha that King Bimbisāra’s chief wife was
dead, and that he ought to send his daughter Upavāsavī, as she would in that case
become the king’s chief wife. Sim̃ha wrote to him in reply, “What this will come to
I will not ask you. But you, who understand the measure of things, will know what
ought to be done. As the people have made a law that no maiden of Vaiśālī may be given
in marriage to an outsider, you must come yourself and wait in the park. I will go
to the park with my daughter, and you can carry her off from there.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Gopāla took leave of the king, mounted his chariot, and set off for Vaiśālī.
Having arrived there, he waited in the park. At that time one of the gatekeepers of
Vaiśālī had died and had been born again among the demons. He gave to the inhabitants
of Vaiśālī the following instructions: “As I have been born again among the demons,
confer on me the position of a Yaksha and hang a bell round my neck. Whenever any
foe to the inhabitants of Vaiśālī appears, I will make the bell sound until he is
arrested or has taken his departure.” So they caused a Yaksha statue to be prepared
and hung a bell round its neck. Then they set it up in the gatehouse, provided with
oblations and garlands, along with dance and song, and to the sound of musical instruments.
</p>
<p>Gopāla sent word to Sim̃ha to come to him, as he was waiting in the park. Taking the
people of Vaiśālī into consideration, Sim̃ha went home and said to Upavāsavī, “You
are to be given to King Bimbisāra as his wife, so take your ornaments and go forth
to the park.” When <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>she began collecting her ornaments, Vāsavī saw her and asked why she was doing that.
</p>
<p>“I am going to be married.”
</p>
<p>“To whom?”
</p>
<p>“To King Bimbisāra.”
</p>
<p>Vāsavī said this could not be done, seeing that she was the elder sister.
</p>
<p>“In that case do you take the ornaments.”
</p>
<p>While they were still discoursing the bell began to sound. The inhabitants of Vaiśālī
were in great commotion, supposing that an enemy had come to Vaiśālī. Full of anxiety,
Sim̃ha took with him his elder daughter, Vāsavī, under the impression that she was
Upavāsavī, and went hastily to the park. There Gopāla, equally full of anxiety, received
Vāsavī into his chariot and drove away.
</p>
<p>The people of Vaiśālī set out in pursuit of him, overtook him, and began to fight
with him. But as he was versed in the five arts of battle, he pierced five hundred
Liććhavis to the heart, and said, “Honoured sirs, as I have pierced five hundred of
your number to the heart, but am ready to leave the rest of you alive, do ye now turn
back.”
</p>
<p>“No living being among us has been killed.”
</p>
<p>“Take off your armour.”
</p>
<p>When they had taken off their armour, five hundred of them fell to the ground and
died. Thereupon the survivors thought that this man must be a Rākshasa, and they fled
away full of terror. When they returned to Vaiśālī they began to take counsel together,
and they said, “Honoured sirs, on this foe of ours we will let King Bimbisāra’s sons
take vengeance. Let us inscribe this on a tablet, place the tablet in a chest, seal
up the chest, and put it away.” All of which they did.
</p>
<p>After a time Gopāla arrived at Rājagṛha and cried, “Upavāsavī, come forth.”
</p>
<p>She replied, “Uncle, I am not Upavāsavī, but Vāsavī.”
</p>
<p>“Why did not you tell me so before?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>She uttered no word in reply. Displeased and troubled, he went to the king, and the
king, as soon as he saw him, said, “Have you come, Gopāla? You are welcome.”
</p>
<p>“I have come, O king.”
</p>
<p>“Have you brought Upavāsavī along with you?”
</p>
<p>“O king! I have brought her and have not brought her.”
</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”
</p>
<p>“I have brought Vāsavī, thinking that she was Upavāsavī.”
</p>
<p>“Bring her here, that I may see her.”
</p>
<p>Now when Vāsavī was brought, and the king saw her perfect youth and beauty, he was
attracted by her to such an extent that he fell in love with her at first sight, and
said, “Honoured one, a son who kills his father must do so merely for the sake of
the sovereignty. Therefore, in case a son is born unto me, I will confer the diadem
on him immediately after his birth.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon he took her as his wife. As she came from Videha, she received the name
of Vaidehī.
</p>
<p>Now there lived in a hermitage a Rishi endowed with five kinds of insight. One day
when the king had gone to the chase, a gazelle terrified by the shooting of arrows
took refuge in the Rishi’s hermitage, and being seen there, was struck by the king’s
arrow. The Rishi said in his wrath, “Will you, O king of evil, kill the gazelle which
had placed itself under my protection, when even beasts of prey respect my hermitage?”
</p>
<p>While the Rishi was calling the king to account with such words as these, the king’s
troops came up and asked to whom these words were being addressed. The king said that
they were levelled at him, and asked what ought to be the punishment for such a calling
to account. The answer was that the proper punishment was that of death. “In that
case,” said the king, “I abandon the Rishi to it.” When the preparations were being
made for <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>putting the Rishi to death, he formulated a curse, desiring that he, wheresoever he
should be born again, might take the king’s life, inasmuch as that king of evil had
ordered him to be put to death without his having committed any fault or done any
harm. Moreover, he reflected that as such kings keep very much out of the way, and
are greatly watched over and guarded, he would scarcely be able to find a fit opportunity
if he were born again anywhere else, and that he must therefore be brought into the
world by this king’s chief wife. By means of this curse he was brought into the world
by Vāsavī.
</p>
<p>On the day of his conception a rain of blood fell. Vāsavī was seized by a desire to
cut flesh from the king’s back and eat it. When she had told the king of this, he
called the soothsayers together and consulted them about it. They decided that it
was caused by the influence of a being which had entered into his wife’s womb. The
king sat absorbed in thought, meditating how he could satisfy her longing. Some sagacious
persons advised him to have a cotton garment lined with raw meat, and to put it on,
and then to offer the meat to his wife. Thereupon the king ordered a cotton garment
to be lined with raw meat, and he put it on, and then offered Vāsavī the meat. She
thought that it was the king’s own flesh, and so ate it, whereby she was freed from
her longing.
</p>
<p>Afterwards a longing came upon her to drink of her husband’s blood, and she told this
to the king. The king had the veins opened in five of his limbs, and gave her the
blood to drink, whereby she was freed from her longing.
</p>
<p>When nine months had passed by, a fine, good-looking boy was born, and on the day
of his birth there fell a rain of blood. The king called the soothsayers together
and consulted them. They said, “O king, so far as we can learn from the words of wisdom,
this son will undoubtedly <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>deprive his father of life, and then set the diadem on his own head and seize the
sovereignty for himself.” The king thought, “As it could only be for the sake of the
sovereignty that he would deprive me of life, he would surely not do so if I were
myself to hand over the sovereignty to him.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>At that time there lived in Vaiśālī a Liććhavi named Mahānāman. In his park there
was an Āmra grove, in which the park-watchers saw that a Kadalī tree had suddenly
grown up. As it immediately began to put forth blossoms, the watchers were greatly
astonished, and they told Mahānāman. He sent for the soothsayers and consulted them.
They decided that he ought to have the tree watched, for it would burst open at the
end of seven days, and from within it a maiden would come forth. The householder Mahānāman,
marvelling greatly at this decision, set careful watchers over the grove and kept
count of the days. When seven days had elapsed, he caused the park to be cleared of
all stones, gravel, and rubble, and to be sprinkled with sandal-water, very fragrant
incense to be provided, many silken hangings to be set up, and flowers to be freely
strewn around. Then he and his wife went out in great state to the park, surrounded
by friends and acquaintances, to the sound of song and all kinds of music. After he
had there sported, rejoiced, and enjoyed himself, the stem of the Kadalī tree burst,
and there came into sight out of it a beautiful maiden, lovely to look upon, perfect
in all parts of her body. Mahānāman handed her over to his good wife, who said, “My
lord, be pleased to give her a name.” Mahānāman said, “As this girl has been obtained
from the Āmra grove, her name ought to be Āmrapālī.<span class="corr" id="xd31e2448" title="Not in source">”</span> Mahānāman returned home and took charge of Āmrapālī.
</p>
<p>She grew up, and there came to woo her, from the Krauncha land and the <span class="corr" id="xd31e2452" title="Source: Śakya">Śākya</span> land and many other lands, many kings’ sons, ministers’ sons, merchants, traders,
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>caravan leaders. The householder Mahānāman reflected that those among them who did
not obtain her would be offended, and that he had better ask the people for a legal
decision. So when the people of Vaiśālī were gathered together he said, “Honourable
Brahmans and householders, give ear! Having obtained a girl from my park, I have brought
her up. As I am now thinking of giving her in marriage to some man of a family corresponding
with my own, so let the people consider the matter.” The men of Vaiśālī replied, “O
householder, the people long ago passed a law that a pearl of a woman was not to be
given in marriage, but should be placed at the disposal of the people. Therefore you
must bring forward the maiden, in order that we may see what she is like.”
</p>
<p>After a time he came into the assembly with her. When the perfection of her youth
and beauty was seen, all the people opened their eyes wide with astonishment, and
when they had critically examined her, some of them cried, “O householder, this is
a pearl of a woman, and therefore she belongs to the enjoyments of the people, and
must not be married to any one.”
</p>
<p>When Mahānāman had returned home in displeasure, and was sitting absorbed in thought,
his cheek leaning upon his arm, <span class="corr" id="xd31e2460" title="Source: Āmrāpālī">Āmrapālī</span> saw him, and asked why he was so dejected.
</p>
<p>“O daughter, you have been recognised as a pearl of a woman, and therefore you belong
to the enjoyments of the people, so that my wishes will not be fulfilled.”
</p>
<p>“O father, are you dependent upon any one<span class="corr" id="xd31e2466" title="Source: .">?</span>”
</p>
<p>“O daughter, as the people formerly made a law that she who is really a pearl of a
woman shall belong to the enjoyments of the people, and as you have now been recognised
as a pearl of a woman, I am powerless.”
</p>
<p>Then she said, “If the people will grant five wishes of mine, I will belong to their
enjoyments. A house must be allotted to me in the first district. When a man has entered
my house, no one else must be allowed the right <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>of entry. Whoever enters must bring with him five hundred Kārshāpaṇas. At the time
when houses are searched, my house must not be searched till seven days have elapsed.
And no heed is to be taken of those who enter or leave my house.” Mahānāman laid Āmrapālī’s
proposal before the people, and they agreed to it, saying, “If she asks for a house
in the first district, a house in the first district befits a pearl of a woman. If
she asks that when one man has entered into her house, no other man should have the
right of entry, that also is just; for as no wrath is so bad as wrath on account of
a woman, in case one man entered in and another came in after him, assuredly one of
them might kill the other. If she makes a stipulation that every one who comes in
must bring with him five hundred Kārshāpaṇas, this likewise is reasonable; she doubtless
requires the money for clothing and ornament. If she asks that her house shall not
be searched till after seven days have elapsed, that also is reasonable; what danger
can arise, whether the search takes place sooner or later? If she wishes no heed to
be taken of the men who enter or leave her house, that again is just. As she is to
be a courtesan, no man would enter her house if he knew that all who went in or came
out would be watched.” So when the people had granted her five wishes, she became
the property of the people for enjoyment.
</p>
<p>After a time,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2477src" href="#xd31e2477">4</a> Āmrapālī sent for painters living in various regions, and ordered them to paint on
her walls the portraits of the kings, ministers, capitalists, merchants, traders,
and caravan leaders whom they had seen. When the painters had completed the portraits,
Āmrapālī put on ornaments of various kinds and inspected the portraits one after the
other, asking the while, “Honoured sirs, who is this?”
</p>
<p>“King Pradyota.”
</p>
<p>“Who is that?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>“That is Prasenajit, king of Kośala.”
</p>
<p>“And this?”
</p>
<p>“Udajana, king of Vatsa.”
</p>
<p>“And that?”
</p>
<p>“Śreṇi Bimbisāra, king of Magadha.”
</p>
<p>In this way she went on asking, and the painters told her all the names. When she
had looked at all the portraits, her eyes remained fixed on that of Bimbisāra, and
she began to reflect whether a man of such port and stature would devote himself to
love with her.
</p>
<p>It happened one day that King Bimbisāra of Magadha went out on the roof of his palace,
and there, surrounded by his band of ministers, he indulged in light talk, asking
them what courtesans they had seen. Gopāla said, “O king, there are others besides,
but in Vaiśālī there is one of exquisite youth and beauty, Āmrapālī by name. She is
versed in the sixty-four arts of love, and deserves, O king, to be enjoyed by thee.”
The king replied, “If that be so, Gopāla, I will betake myself to Vaiśālī and enjoy
myself with her.” Gopāla called his attention to the fact that danger might threaten
him on the part of the Liććhavis, who had long entertained hostile sentiments towards
him. The king was of opinion that men who possessed manly hearts might always go anywhere.
Gopāla said, “O king, if a man attaches importance to matters of small account, let
him go.” The king mounted his chariot and betook himself with Gopāla to Vaiśālī.
</p>
<p>When they arrived there, Gopāla remained in the park, but the king went to Āmrapālī’s
house. Then the bell began to sound. The Liććhavis of Vaiśālī became greatly excited,
thinking that as the bell had rung an enemy must have penetrated into the city. A
great uproar arose, and King Bimbisāra asked Āmrapālī what it meant.
</p>
<p>“O king, the houses are being searched.”
</p>
<p>“On what account?”
</p>
<p>“On your account, O king!”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>“What is to be done, then? Shall I take to flight?”
</p>
<p>“O king, be not troubled. As my house will not be searched till seven days have elapsed,
you can go on enjoying yourself for seven days; therefore enjoy yourself. When seven
days are over, you will know that it is time to go.” So he enjoyed himself with her,
and she became with child by him. When she informed him of that, he gave her a robe
and a ring, and said, “If it be a daughter, let her remain with you. But if it be
a son, put on him this robe, press the seal of this ring on his neck, and send him
to me.”
</p>
<p>After leaving Āmrapālī’s house, the king mounted his chariot and drove away with Gopāla.
But the bell sounded. The Liććhavis, under the impression that an enemy had appeared,
gave orders that he should be searched for, and sent after him five hundred men armed
with arrows and spears.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2502src" href="#xd31e2502">5</a> When Gopāla saw them, he asked the king whether he would do the fighting or conduct
the chariot. The king replied, “I am weary, so I will conduct the chariot, but do
you fight with them.” When Gopāla began to enter into combat with them, the inhabitants
of Vaiśālī recognised him, and said, “Honoured sirs, this is a Rākshasa of a man,
let us turn back.” So they returned to Vaiśālī, and passed a resolution that they
would let the children of Bimbisāra take vengeance on this foe of theirs.
</p>
<p>Now when nine months had gone by, Āmrapālī gave birth to a fine, good-looking boy.
While he was a growing lad, he was playing one day with the sons of the Liććhavis
of Vaiśālī, and they addressed him with scoffing words, saying, “Son of a female slave,
born from among the many hundreds of thousands, who is your father?” He went in tears
to his mother. She asked him why he wept, <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>and he told her the whole story. She said to him, “If any one asks you that again,
reply, ‘There is not one among you who has such a father as I have.’ If they inquire
who he is, tell them that he is King Bimbisāra.”
</p>
<p>So when the children were again at play, and they questioned him as before, he replied
that there was no one among them who had such a father as he had. “Who is he?” they
cried. When he had mentioned the name of King Bimbisāra, they ill treated him all
the more, because his father was their enemy. He told all this with tears to his mother,
who reflected that the Liććhavis of Vaiśālī were very fierce and strong, and that
they might find an opportunity of putting him to death.
</p>
<p>After thinking over all this, she found out that a number of merchants were travelling
with goods to Rājagṛha, so she said to them, “You and your packages will be able to
pass in without paying duty if they are sealed with the seal of this ring. Take the
boy with you to the king’s palace, and place him, after stamping the seal of this
ring on his neck, at the gate of Rājagṛha.” The merchants promised to act in accordance
with these instructions. Then she gave the boy a string of pearls, and said, “O son,
betake yourself in the way of business to the king; lay the string of pearls at his
feet and climb up to his breast. Should any one say, ‘This is a boy who knows no fear,’
ask whether a son has anything to fear from his father?”
</p>
<p>When the merchants had arrived at Rājagṛha with the boy, they gave him a bath, stamped
him with the seal, and took him to the gate of the palace. The boy made his way to
where the king was, laid the string of pearls at the king’s feet, and climbed up to
his breast. The king said, “This boy seems to be without fear.” The boy replied, “Has
a son anything to fear from his father?”
</p>
<p>As the king had in this way given utterance to the words “without fear,” the boy was
named Prince Abhaya [or fearless.]
<span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>King Bimbisāra, who was always longing after strange women, used to mount his elephant
and roam through the streets of the city, turning his eyes this way and that. There
lived at that time in Rājagṛha a very rich merchant, who told his wife one day that
he was obliged to go into foreign parts with merchandise. After he had gone away,
his wife, who fed delicately and dressed in fine raiment, was affected by desire.
So when King Bimbisāra came riding on his elephant near her house, she seated herself
at the window and threw him a wreath of flowers. The king caught sight of her and
called on her to come down, but she said, “O king, I am afraid. It were better that
you should come in here.”
</p>
<p>The king entered her house and took his pleasure therein; and as all things were propitious,
she became with child. When she had made the king aware of this, he gave her a signet
ring and a motley robe, and said to her, “If a son is born unto you, clothe him in
this robe, stamp this seal on his neck, and send him to me. But if a girl is born
unto you, she can remain with you.” Having thus spoken, he went his way.
</p>
<p>Now when the merchant had finished his business and had arrived in the neighbourhood
of Rājagṛha, he sent a message to his wife saying, “Rejoice, good wife! I have arrived
here after finishing my business, and I shall return home on such and such a day.”
Then she reflected that she had committed so great a fault, and she knew not what
she was to do when her husband arrived. In her trouble she sent tidings thereof to
the king. The king sent her back word that she should be of good cheer, for he would
manage in such a way that her husband would not return home so soon. Accordingly he
sent a messenger to the caravan leader, letting him know that such and such precious
stones were required, and that he must not come back without bringing them. So the
merchant was obliged to make a long journey on account of those precious stones.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>When nine months had elapsed, the merchant’s wife gave birth to a fine, good-looking
boy. As women, even without receiving instruction, are full of knowledge, she fed
the babe on butter and honey, stamped the seal of the ring on his neck, wrapped him
in the robe, laid him in a chest, and ordered her serving-maid to deposit the chest
at the gate of the king’s palace, after having set lamps around it and lighted them,
and then to keep watch till some one should take the child in.
</p>
<p>All this the maid did. When the king had come out on the roof of his palace, and was
standing there with Prince Abhaya, he perceived the lamps at the door of his palace.
So he ordered his servants to find out what was the meaning of there being lamps burning
at the palace door. The servants brought back word that there was a chest there. The
king ordered it to be fetched, but Prince Abhaya besought the king to give to him
whatever should be found within the chest. The king acceded to his request. When the
chest had been fetched and laid before the king, he gave orders that it should be
opened. When it was opened a boy was seen inside it. The king asked if the child was
alive or dead. He was told that it was alive. Then the king recognised the seal and
the robe, and he made over the child to Prince Abhaya. The prince brought him up,
and as the king had asked if he was alive, and as Prince Abhaya had looked after his
maintenance, the boy received the name of Jīvaka Kumārabhaṇḍa.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2533src" href="#xd31e2533">6</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>When Jīvaka had grown up, he was sitting one day conversing with Abhaya. Abhaya said
that it was incumbent on them to learn some craft, whereby they might <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>gain their bread later on. For even before the birth of Ajātaśatru it had been predicted
that the sovereign power would appertain to him. When <span class="corr" id="xd31e2548" title="Source: they">the</span> two had considered this matter, a white-clad coachmaker, surrounded by a number of
men clad in white, entered the king’s palace. When Prince Abhaya saw him, he asked
the king’s people who that man was. They replied that he was a coachmaker.
</p>
<p>“How much does he earn?”
</p>
<p>“He earns his living.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon he thought that he too, after he had asked the king, would learn coachmaking.
So he went to the king and told him that he wished to learn coachmaking. The king
asked whether he desired to earn his bread in that way.
</p>
<p>“Father, kings’ sons are in the habit of learning all arts.”
</p>
<p>“In that case, O son, learn coachmaking.”
</p>
<p>So he began to study coachmaking.
</p>
<p>Jīvaka also, having seen a white-clad physician, surrounded by several men clad in
white, entering the king’s palace, asked who that was.
</p>
<p>“He is a physician,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>“What does he do?”
</p>
<p>“He cures.”
</p>
<p>“What does he earn?”
</p>
<p>“When he cures a patient he receives his fee; but if the patient dies, he receives
nothing, for nothing is given.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Jīvaka resolved to study the healing art. He went to his father and said,
“O king, allow me to study the healing art.”
</p>
<p>“O son, you are a king’s son. What do you want to do with the healing art?”
</p>
<p>“O king, kings’ sons are in the habit of learning all arts.”
</p>
<p>“In that case, O son, learn this art.”
</p>
<p>So Jīvaka began to study the healing art.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he had studied it well, but had not as yet learnt how to open skulls, he had
recourse to the king of physicians, Ātreya in Takshaśilā, of whom he had heard that
he understood the art of skull-opening. Going to the king, he told him that he was
about to journey to Takshaśilā.
</p>
<p>“What for?”
</p>
<p>“The king of physicians, Ātreya, lives there, who understands the art of opening the
skull. It is in order to learn that art that I wish to go there.”
</p>
<p>“Do you desire, O son, to make a living thereby?”
</p>
<p>“O king, a man must either not study the art of healing at all, or he must study it
thoroughly.”
</p>
<p>“In that case, O son, go thither.”
</p>
<p>The king wrote a letter to King Pushkarasārin, saying, “My son is going to Ātreya
in order to study the healing art. Provide him with all things which he may require.”
</p>
<p>In the course of time Jīvaka arrived at <span class="corr" id="xd31e2581" title="Source: Takshasilā">Takshaśilā</span>, and Pushkarasārin, after reading the letter, handed him over to Ātreya, to whom
he gave orders to instruct in the healing art the prince who had come there on his
account. When Ātreya began to teach him, Jīvaka mastered everything excellently at
the slightest intimation. Now Ātreya was wont, when he visited a patient, to take
a young Brahman along with him. One day he took Jīvaka also, gave him directions to
administer such and such remedies, and then went away. Jīvaka thought, “In the present
case the master has made a mistake. If the patient takes this medicine, he will die
this very day. As the remedy which the master has prescribed is not good, I will contrive
an expedient.<span class="corr" id="xd31e2584" title="Not in source">”</span> So he left the house along with Ātreya, and said when he came back again, “The doctor
has told me not to give the medicine which he has prescribed, but such and such a
remedy.” When the patient had been treated in this way, he became better. The next
time Ātreya visited the patient, after asking how he was getting on, he gave directions
that the same medicine should be given to him <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>on the following day. Being asked whether he meant the medicine which he had prescribed
first or that which he had afterwards ordered, he said, “What did I prescribe first,
and what afterwards?” He was told, “You prescribed the one when you were present here;
about the other you gave orders to Jīvaka.” He said to himself, “I made a mistake.
Jīvaka is endowed with great insight.” Then he said that the medicine which Jīvaka
had prescribed was to be given.
</p>
<p>Ātreya became well pleased with Jīvaka, and took him along with him wherever he went.
The Brahmans’ sons said, “O teacher, you are well pleased with him because he is a
king’s son, and you bestow instruction upon him, but none upon us.” He replied, “That
is not the case. Jīvaka possesses great intelligence, and he is able to comprehend
intuitively whatever I indicate to him.” They said, “O teacher, how do you know this?”
He said to the Brahmans’ sons, “Go and ask the price of various commodities, you of
such a one, you of such another.” And having so spoken he sent them off to the market.
He also gave orders to Jīvaka to ask the price of a certain article. The Brahmans’
sons did as they were bid. Jīvaka did likewise. But then he said to himself, “Suppose
the master asks the prices of other wares, what shall I be able to reply? I will make
myself acquainted with the prices of other commodities as well.” When they had all
returned to their teacher, they rendered an account of those things which they had
been ordered to do. Then Ātreya began to ask the price of articles which he had not
mentioned, saying, “O Brahman’s son, what does this or that commodity cost?” He whom
he questioned replied that he did not know. In like manner did the others make reply
when he questioned them. But Jīvaka, when he was asked, told him the price of every
kind of goods.
</p>
<p>“O Brahmans’ sons,” said Ātreya, “have ye heard?”
</p>
<p>“We have heard.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Behold, this is the reason why I said that Jīvaka, as he is possessed of remarkable
insight, intuitively comprehends any matter on a slight intimation being given to
him. I will give you yet another proof of this.”
</p>
<p>Then he said to his pupils, “Go to the pine-hill, and fetch from it that which is
no remedy.” They went thither, and each of them brought away that which he thought
was no remedy. But Jīvaka reflected that there is scarcely anything which is not a
remedy, so he brought away only a knot from a reed and a morsel of stone. Halfway
back he met a herd-girl, who was carrying a jug of curdled milk and a leavening pot,
and who was intending to go to Ātreya, as she was suffering greatly with her eyes.
Jīvaka asked her where she was going. When she had told him, he showed her a remedy
which was near at hand. She applied it, and was cured at once. Full of joy thereat
she said, “Take this pot and this jug of curdled milk.” He accepted the pot, but he
gave her back the jug of curdled milk. Then he went on his way carrying the pot.
</p>
<p>Now the Brahmans’ sons saw some elephant tracks in the middle of the road, and took
to inspecting them. When Jīvaka came up with them, he asked what those marks were.
“Footprints of an elephant,” they replied. He said, “Those are the footprints of an
elephant, not male but female, blind of the right eye, and about to bring forth young
to-day. On it a woman was riding. She too is blind of the right eye, and she will
bear a son to-day.”
</p>
<p>When they had all returned to Ātreya, each of them showed what he had brought away
with him. Ātreya said, “O Brahmans’ sons, all these things are remedies. This one
is of use in such and such an illness, and the others in other illnesses.” When Jīvaka
was asked what he had brought, he said, “O teacher, all things are remedies; there
exists nothing which is not a remedy. However, I have brought with me the knot of
a reed, a morsel of stone, and a leavening pot.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Of what use are these things?”
</p>
<p>“If a man is stung by a scorpion, he can be fumigated with the reed knot and healed
with the leavening pot, and with the morsel of stone can a pot of curdled milk be
broken at harvest-time.”
</p>
<p>Ātreya laughed. The Brahmans’ sons thought that the teacher was displeased with him,
so they said, “O teacher, do you suppose that is all? We saw the track of an elephant
in the middle of the road, and Jīvaka declared that the track was that of a female
elephant, blind of the right eye and big with young, and that it will bring forth
a young elephant to-day; and also that a woman had been seated upon it, who was also
pregnant and blind of the right eye, and who will give birth to-day to a son.”
</p>
<p>Ātreya asked, “O Jīvaka, is this true?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, O teacher.”
</p>
<p>“How did you know whether the footprints were those of a male or of a female elephant?”
</p>
<p>“O teacher,” replied Jīvaka, “how could I, who was brought up in a royal family, help
knowing that? The footprints of a male elephant are round, those of a female elephant
are oblong.”
</p>
<p>“How did you know that she was blind of the right eye?”
</p>
<p>“Because she had eaten the grass which grew on the left side only.”
</p>
<p>“How did you know that she is big with young?”
</p>
<p>“Because she had pressed hard with her feet.”
</p>
<p>“How did you know that she will give birth to a male foal?”
</p>
<p>“Because she pressed hardest on the right side.”
</p>
<p>“How did you know that a woman had been riding on the elephant?”
</p>
<p>“From her track in the road when she alighted.”
</p>
<p>“How did you know that she was blind of the right eye?”
</p>
<p>“Because as she walked she plucked the flowers which grew on the left side only.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>“How did you know that she was with child?”
</p>
<p>“Because the heels of her feet had made the deepest impression. All this is so, but
if the teacher does not believe me, let him send one of the Brahmans’ sons to the
inn.”
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd31e2624" title="Source: Atreya">Ātreya</span> sent some of them there, and all turned out to be just as Jīvaka had said. Then Ātreya
said to the Brahmans’ sons, “O Brahmans’ sons, have ye comprehended? After such a
fashion is Jīvaka’s intelligence remarkable.”
</p>
<p>Jīvaka had learnt the whole art of healing, with the exception of the operation of
skull-opening. Now a man who was afflicted by a cerebral malady came to Ātreya and
asked him to treat him. <span class="corr" id="xd31e2629" title="Source: Atreya">Ātreya</span> replied that the man must dig a pit that day and provide it with dung, and that next
day he would take the case in hand. When Jīvaka heard this, he went to him and said,
“O friend, all that I have learnt have I learnt for the benefit of mankind. As I have
not yet learnt the operation of skull-opening, hide me away so that I may see how
you perform it.” <span class="corr" id="xd31e2632" title="Source: Atreya">Ātreya</span> promised to do so, and showed him a place to hide in.
</p>
<p>When Ātreya came, he placed the man in the pit, opened his skull, and was about to
seize the reptile with his pincers, when Jīvaka cried out, “O teacher, be not hasty
in seizing it; otherwise this son of a good family might die to-day.”
</p>
<p>“Are you there, Jīvaka?” asked <span class="corr" id="xd31e2638" title="Source: Atreya">Ātreya</span>.
</p>
<p>“Yes, teacher,” he replied.
</p>
<p>“How then ought I to seize the reptile?”
</p>
<p>“O teacher, warm the pincers and touch its back therewith. Then, if the reptile draws
its arms and feet together, give it a toss out.”
</p>
<p>When all this had been done the man was cured.
</p>
<p>Then Ātreya said, “O Jīvaka, go and bathe, and then come to me. As I am much pleased,
I will communicate to you after what fashion the skull is opened.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>Jīvaka bathed, and Ātreya showed him after what fashion the skull ought to be opened.
Then <span class="corr" id="xd31e2651" title="Source: Atreya">Ātreya</span> said, “O Jīvaka, as I earn my bread thereby, do not practise the art in this country.”
</p>
<p>“O teacher, I will act accordingly.”
</p>
<p>With these words Jīvaka paid his respects to <span class="corr" id="xd31e2657" title="Source: Atreya">Ātreya</span>. Then he went to King Pushkarasārin, and informed him that, as he had now learnt
the art of healing, he was about to take his departure.
</p>
<p>Now there were in the borderland at that time some enemies of Pushkarasārin named
Pāṇḍavas. Then said the king, “O Jīvaka, my enemies the Pāṇḍavas are in the borderland;
bring them to discomfiture by the force of your intelligence, and afterwards come
back here. Then will we proceed after the fashion of the world.” Jīvaka promised to
do so. As soon as a fourfold army had been equipped, he set out, discomfited the Pāṇḍavas
of the borderland, took hostages and tribute from them, and then, having returned
safely, handed over to the king what he had taken. The king was greatly pleased, and
bestowed presents on Jīvaka, as Jīvaka did on Ātreya.
</p>
<p>Jīvaka journeyed by degrees to Bhadram̃kara, and having arrived in that city, spent
the summer there. After learning there the Śāstra, “Language of all Creatures,” he
departed from Bhadram̃kara. Seeing a man carrying a load of wood to the city, of whom
nothing was left but skin and bone, and the whole of whose body was dropping sweat,
he said to him, “O friend, how came you into such a plight?” The man replied, “I know
not. But I have got into this state since I began to carry this load.” Jīvaka carefully
inspected the wood, and said, “Friend, will you sell this wood?”
</p>
<p>“Yes!”
</p>
<p>“For how much money?”
</p>
<p>“For five hundred Kārshāpaṇas.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>Jīvaka bought the wood, and when he had examined it, he discovered the gem which brings
all beings to belief. The virtue of the gem is of this kind: when it is placed before
an invalid, it illuminates him as a lamp lights up all the objects in a house, and
so reveals the nature of his malady.
</p>
<p>When Jīvaka had gradually made his way to the Udumbara land, he found there a man
who was measuring with a measure, and who, when he had finished measuring, inflicted
a wound upon his head with the measure. When Jīvaka saw this, he asked him why he
behaved in that way.
</p>
<p>“My head itches greatly.”
</p>
<p>“Come here and I will look at it.”
</p>
<p>The man lay down and Jīvaka examined his head. Then he laid on the man’s head the
gem which brings all beings to belief, and it immediately became manifest that there
was a centipede inside. Thereupon Jīvaka said, “O man, there is a centipede inside
your head.” The man touched his feet and said, “Cure me.” Jīvaka promised to do so,
but he thought, “I will act according to the words of the teacher.” So he said, “O
man, dig a pit to-day and have dung in readiness. I will take your case in hand to-morrow.”
The man touched his feet and went away. Next day Jīvaka placed the man in the pit,
opened the skull with the proper instrument, touched the back of the centipede with
the heated pincers, and then, when the centipede drew its arms and feet together,
he seized it with the pincers and pulled it out. Thereupon the patient recovered.
The man gave Jīvaka five hundred Kārshāpaṇas, which he sent to Ātreya.
</p>
<p>After this Jīvaka came to the Rohitaka land. A householder had died there who had
possessed a park with beautiful flowers, fruits, and water, and who, as he had been
excessively fond of the garden, had been born again there among the demons. When his
son became master of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>house, he appointed a certain man to watch over the park. The watchman, however, was
killed by that demon, as was also a second watchman, after which the son of the deceased
householder abandoned the park. Thereupon a dropsical man, whom all the doctors had
given up, came to that park and took up his quarters there for the night, thinking
that it would not much matter if the demon were to kill him. Now it happened that
Jīvaka also spent the night in this park. The demon began to threaten the dropsical
man. Then stepped forward the Dropsy and said, “As I have already taken possession
of this man, wherefore do you threaten him? Is there no one here who will fumigate
you with the smoke of goats’ hair? That would make you fly twelve yojanas away?” The
demon replied, “Is there no one here to give you radish-seed pounded and beaten up
in butter? Thereby would you be broken to pieces.” Jīvaka heard all this, and next
morning he visited the householder, and asked him why he had abandoned the park which
was so rich in flowers, fruits, and water. The householder told him all that had occurred.
Then said Jīvaka, “O householder, fumigate the park with the smoke of goats’ hair.
Then will the demon fly twelve yojanas away.” The householder did so, and the demon
flew twelve yojanas away. This householder also gave five hundred Kārshāpaṇas to Jīvaka,
who sent them as before to Ātreya.
</p>
<p>Afterwards Jīvaka asked the dropsical man why he abode in the demon-haunted park.
The man told him everything that had occurred. Jīvaka said to him, “Swallow radish-seed
pounded and beaten up in butter, and you will recover.” The man took the remedy and
recovered his health. This man also gave five hundred Kārshāpaṇas to Jīvaka, who,
as before, sent them to Ātreya.
</p>
<p>Jīvaka gradually made his way to Mathurā, where he rested under a tree outside the
city. Now it had come to pass there that a wrestler was smitten by an antagonist,
and his bowels were displaced, so that he died and was <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>carried out to be buried. A vulture and her little ones had their nest on a tree,
and one young vulture said, “Mother, give us flesh.” She replied, “Children, where
is flesh to be found?” The young birds said, “Mother, as that Malla who was smitten
in wrestling is dead and has been carried out, flesh is to be found there where he
is.”
</p>
<p>“O children, the king of doctors, Jīvaka, has come here, and will set him to rights
again.”
</p>
<p>“Mother, in what manner will he set him to rights?”
</p>
<p>“By applying a certain powder to his bowels.”
</p>
<p>Jīvaka overheard all this. So he arose and went to where the corpse was, and inquired,
saying, “Honoured sirs, whom have ye here?”
</p>
<p>“A man who died after being struck down while wrestling,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>“Lay him down that I may look at him,” said Jīvaka.
</p>
<p>The dead man was laid down, and Jīvaka placed on his head the gem which brings all
beings to belief. Perceiving that the man’s entrails had been displaced, he blew some
powder into the body through a hollow reed, and as soon as the powder had reached
the entrails the man recovered. This man also gave five hundred Kārshāpaṇas to Jīvaka,
who, as before, sent them to <span class="corr" id="xd31e2691" title="Source: Atreya">Ātreya</span>.
</p>
<p>Now there was in Mathurā a householder who had a wife of consummate youth and beauty,
whom he loved exceedingly. After his death he was born again as a reptile in the lower
part of his wife’s body.… When she heard that the physician Jīvaka had arrived, she
went to see him, and said that she was ill, and that he must treat her.… He ordered
her to lay aside her garments, and then he expelled the worm in the way in which,
as will presently be described, he got rid of the centipede which had crept into a
man’s ear. Whereupon the patient recovered. As her desires were enhanced by passion,
she made overtures to him, but he shut his ears and said, “You seem to me like a Rākshasī.
I who have cured <span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>you am contented with having done so.” She also gave him five hundred Kārshāpaṇas,
which likewise he sent to <span class="corr" id="xd31e2698" title="Source: Atreya">Ātreya</span>.
</p>
<p>After this Jīvaka went on by degrees and reached the shore of the river Yamunā. There
he saw a corpse which, when the fish twitched the sinews of its heels, opened its
eyes and smiled. Observing all this, he became aware of the connection which exists
between the sinews and the rest of the body.
</p>
<p>Having gradually made his way to Vaiśālī, he found there a wrestler the ball of whose
eye protruded in consequence of a blow from a fist. Jīvaka paid him a visit, pulled
the sinews of his heel, and restored the eye to its right place. This man also gave
him five hundred Kārshāpaṇas, which he gave to Abhaya’s mother.
</p>
<p>At Vaiśālī there lived a man into whose ear a centipede had crept, and had therein
given birth to seven hundred young ones. Tormented by his pains in the ear, this man
went to Jīvaka and intreated him to cure him. Jīvaka said to himself, “Hitherto I
have acted in accordance with my teacher’s instructions, but now I will act according
to my own intelligence.” He said to the man, “Go and make a hut out of foliage, carpet
it with blue stuff, place a drum underneath, and make the ground warm.” The man provided
everything as he was told. Then Jīvaka made the man lie down, sprinkled the ground
with water, and beat the drum. Thereupon the centipede, thinking that the summer was
come, crept out. Then Jīvaka placed a piece of meat on the ear. The reptile turned
back, but presently came out again with its young ones, and they all laid hold of
the piece of meat. Whereupon Jīvaka flung it into the flesh-pot, and the man recovered
his health. He gave Jīvaka five hundred Kārshāpaṇas, and Jīvaka gave them to Abhaya’s
mother.
</p>
<p>After a time Jīvaka came to Rājagṛha, and King Bimbisāra, hearing of his arrival,
ordered Prince Ajātaśatru to go out to meet his elder brother. The prince set out
on <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>the way. But when Jīvaka heard that Prince Ajātaśatru was coming to meet him, he reflected
that if he consented to this reception, Ajātaśatru, when he became king, might do
him some harm. So he turned back, and entered the city by another gate.
</p>
<p>On another occasion, when Jīvaka was strolling along surrounded by a great crowd,
a Brahman who was afflicted with an eye disease accosted him, and begged him to prescribe
a remedy. He replied angrily, “Sprinkle the eye with ashes.” The man, who was of a
simple nature, did as he was told, and he became well.
</p>
<p>Another man, also afflicted with an eye disease, was on his way to visit Jīvaka, when
the Brahman saw him and asked him where he was going. When the man had told him, the
Brahman said, “What need have you of Jīvaka? Do what he told me to do.” The man gave
heed to the words of the Brahman, sprinkled his eye with ashes, and became blind.
</p>
<p>At another time, a tumour formed on the crown of King Bimbisāra’s head. He ordered
his ministers to summon the physicians. The ministers did so, and the king told the
physicians to treat the tumour. They said, “O king, as the great physician Jīvaka
is here, why should we deal with it?” So the king ordered Jīvaka to be summoned. When
he had been introduced, the king asked him to undertake the case. He consented to
do so, on the condition that he should be allowed to give the king his bath. Then
he anointed the tumour with myrobalan and with ripening substances, and he poured
over it five hundred jugs of water in which such substances had been infused. When
it was ripe he secretly touched it with a razor and squeezed it out. Then he applied
healing remedies, and poured over it five hundred jugs of water in which such substances
had been infused. Whereupon the wound healed so completely that the skin and the hair
were perfectly even. When the king’s bath was finished, he said that Jīvaka was now
to begin the operation. Jīvaka replied, <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>“O king, be pleased to partake of food.” When the king had eaten, he again called
upon Jīvaka to proceed. “O king,” said Jīvaka, “the operation has been performed.”
The king would not believe this, but when he felt with his hand, he could not find
the place where the hurt had been. Moreover, when he took a mirror and looked in it,
he could see nothing. He asked his wife, but neither could she find the place where
the hurt had been. The king was greatly astonished, and he said to his ministers,
“Honoured sirs, appoint Jīvaka king of the physicians.” But the man who had become
blind said, “O king, is it from love towards your son or on account of his knowledge
of things that you give him this appointment?” The king replied, “On account of his
knowledge of things.” The blind man said, “However this may be, he has not cured me.”
Jīvaka said, “O man, I have never seen you before; how, then, could I have cured you?”
The blind man replied, “That is true; but he to whom you did prescribe a remedy taught
me what to do.”
</p>
<p>“What did he teach you to do?”
</p>
<p>“Such and such things.”
</p>
<p>“Your nature and that man’s nature are different,” said Jīvaka. “Now do this and that,
and you will be made whole.”
</p>
<p>The man acted accordingly and was made whole. Then he said, “O king, be pleased to
let Jīvaka be appointed king of the physicians.” So Jīvaka was seated upon an elephant,
and with great pomp was installed king of the physicians.
</p>
<p>There lived in Rājagṛha a householder who suffered from a swelling of the glands,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2721src" href="#xd31e2721">7</a> and had been given up by all the physicians. He resolved to go to Jīvaka. If he could
be cured by him, well and good; if not, then he was ready to die. He came to Jīvaka,
and entreated him to <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>cure him. Jīvaka said that the remedies which his case required were hard to find.
Thus the man thought, “As even Jīvaka has given me up, what is there for me to do?
As my time has come, I will die of my own accord.” So he went away to the cemetery.
Now a corpse was being burnt there, and an ichneumon and a lizard, which were fighting
with one another, fell into the fire. Being tormented by hunger, he devoured them
both. Then he drank some rain-water which he found in the cemetery, and afterwards
he betook himself to a cattle-shed in the neighbourhood of the cemetery, where he
fed upon kodrava<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2730src" href="#xd31e2730">8</a> porridge and sour milk mixed with butter. Thereupon the tumour gave way, and he,
after it had discharged upwards and downwards, was restored to health.
</p>
<p>At another time Vaidehī suffered from a tumour in the groin. She communicated the
fact to the king, who ordered Jīvaka to cure his stepmother. Jīvaka undertook the
case, prepared a poultice, and asked her to sit down upon it. After examining the
poultice on which she had sat, he perceived where the diseased spot was. Then he applied
maturing means, and when he saw that the tumour was ripe, he concealed a lancet in
the poultice, and gave directions to the queen-mother as to how she was to sit down
upon it and rise up again. She acted accordingly, and the tumour gave way as soon
as it was pricked by the lancet. He then caused it to be washed with bitter water
mixed with healing substances, and applied healing substances to it, after which she
became well.
</p>
<p>Jīvaka went to the king, who asked him if he had healed his stepmother. He replied
that he had done so.
</p>
<p>“But you have not looked upon her without her clothing?”
</p>
<p>“No!”
</p>
<p>“How then did you manage?”
</p>
<p>When Jīvaka had described what he had contrived, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>king marvelled greatly, and gave orders to the ministers to install Jīvaka a second
time as king of the physicians.
</p>
<p>But the man with the swelling of the glands, to whom Jīvaka had said that it would
be difficult to find a remedy for his ailment, asked the king whether he had ordered
Jīvaka to be installed as king of the physicians out of love for his son or on account
of that son’s knowledge of things. The king replied, “On account of his knowledge.”
</p>
<p>“However this may be, he has not cured me.”
</p>
<p>“O man,” said Jīvaka, “I did not undertake your case. I merely said that it would
be difficult to find you a remedy.”
</p>
<p>“What is the remedy in my case?” asked the man.
</p>
<p>“If on the fourteenth day of the waxing moon,” replied Jīvaka, “a fair-haired man
dies and is burnt at the cemetery; and if at that time an ichneumon and a lizard are
fighting with one another and fall into the fire; and if you eat both of them, and
then drink of the water of the rain poured down by Mahesvara on the cemetery; and
if you afterwards partake of kodrava porridge and curdled milk mixed with butter,
in that case you will recover. It was because I thought of all this that I told you
that the remedy would be a difficult one to find.”
</p>
<p>Then the man said, “Your knowledge is excellent, for these are the very things of
which I have partaken.” And he joyfully exclaimed, “O king, as Jīvaka deserves to
be king of the physicians, let him be appointed to that office.”
</p>
<p>And so Jīvaka was for the second time installed as king of the physicians.
</p>
<p>At the time when Ajātaśatru, impelled by Devadatta, the friend of vice, deprived of
his life his father, the lawful king, he fell ill with an internal tumour. He called
upon the physicians to cure him. They replied, “O king, as your elder brother is here,
Jīvaka, the king of the physicians, wherefore should we cure you?” So the king told
his ministers to call in Jīvaka. This was done, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>the king charged him to remove the tumour, which he undertook to do.
</p>
<p>Jīvaka reflected that the tumour might yield to one of two influences, either that
of excessive joy or that of excessive wrath. And that as it would be impossible to
arouse excessive joy within so sinful a man, it would be necessary at all risks to
excite in him excessive wrath. So he told the king that he could heal him, provided
that the king would feed on Prince Udajibhadra’s flesh.
</p>
<p>When the king heard this he became furious, and cried, “Very good! I have killed my
father, and you want to put Udajibhadra to death. Then if I die of this complaint
you will be king.”
</p>
<p>Jīvaka replied, “Such are the means of effecting a cure; in no other way can I restore
you to health.”
</p>
<p>When the king had given his consent, Jīvaka brought Prince Udajibhadra before the
king, robed in all stately array, and said, “O king, take pains to look well at Prince
Udajibhadra, for after this you will not be able to see him again.” Having thus exhibited
him, he took him to his own house and there hid him away.
</p>
<p>He then went to the cemetery of Śitavana in search of human flesh. There was no lack
of corpses there, and from one of these corpses he took some flesh and carried it
away with him. This he prepared with the most excellent materials, and then he served
it up to the king at dinner-time. When King Ajātaśatru had received the bowl of flesh-broth,
and was preparing to partake of it, Jīvaka seized it, hit him over the head with it,
and said to him, “O evil-doer, you have taken the life of your own father, and now
you want to feed on the flesh of your own son.”
</p>
<p>The king cried in his wrath, “If this be so, why have you put him to death?”
</p>
<p>As he thus broke out in anger, his tumour gave way, and discharged upwards and downwards,
its contents coming to light mixed with blood from the wound. <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>When the king saw that, he fell fainting to the ground. But after he had been sprinkled
with water he came to himself, and then, when he had bathed and partaken of strengthening
nourishment, he recovered his health.
</p>
<p>After that, Jīvaka brought before the king Prince Udajibhadra arrayed in all state,
and touched the king’s feet and said, “O king, here stands Prince Udajibhadra. I would
not deprive an ant of its life, not to speak of the prince. But as it was only by
this contrivance that the king’s life could be saved, therefore did I contrive it.”
The king marvelled greatly, and gave orders to his ministers to install Jīvaka for
the third time as the king of the physicians. The ministers set him upon an elephant
and with great pomp installed him for the third time as king of the physicians.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mṛgadhara, the first minister of King Prasenajit of Kośala, after he had married a
wife of birth like unto his own, had seven sons. To six of these he gave names at
his pleasure, but the youngest one he called Viśākha.
</p>
<p>After his wife’s death he arranged marriages for his six elder sons, but they and
their wives gave themselves up to dress, and troubled themselves in no wise with household
affairs.
</p>
<p>The householder Mṛgadhara was sitting one day absorbed in thought, resting his cheek
upon his arm. A Brahman, who was on friendly terms with him, saw him sitting thus
absorbed in thought, and asked him what was the cause of his behaviour. He replied,
“My sons and their wives have given themselves up to dress, and do not trouble themselves
about household affairs, so that the property is going to ruin.”
</p>
<p>“Why do you not arrange a marriage for Viśākha?”
</p>
<p>“Who can tell whether he will make things better, or bring them to still greater ruin?”
</p>
<p>“If you will trust to me, I will look for a maiden for him.”
</p>
<p>The minister consented, and the Brahman went his way. In the course of his researches
he came to the land of Champā. In it there lived a householder named Balamitra, whose
daughter Viśākhā was fair to see, well proportioned, <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>in the bloom of youth, intelligent and clever. Just as the Brahman arrived, she and
some other girls who were in quest of amusement were setting out for a park. On seeing
the girls, he thought that he would like to look at them a little. So he followed
slowly after them, occupied in regarding them. The girls, who were for the most part
of a frivolous nature, sometimes ran, sometimes skipped, sometimes rolled about, sometimes
laughed, sometimes spun round, sometimes sang, and did other undignified things. But
Viśākhā, with the utmost decorum, at an even pace walked slowly along with them. When
they came to the park, the other girls undressed at the edge of the tank, entered
into it, and began to sport. But Viśākhā lifted up her clothes by degrees as she went
into the water, and by degrees let them down again as she came out of the water, so
circumspect was she in her behaviour. After their bath, when the girls had assembled
at a certain spot, they first partook of food themselves, and then gave to their attendants
to eat; but Viśākhā first of all gave food to the persons in attendance, and then
herself began to eat.
</p>
<p>When the girls had finished their eating and drinking and had enjoyed the charm of
the park, they went away. As there was water to be waded through on the road, the
girls took off their boots and walked through it, but Viśākhā kept her boots on. They
went a little farther and came to a wood. Into this Amra wood she entered, keeping
her parasol up, though the others had discarded theirs. Presently a wind arose together
with rain, and the other girls took shelter in a temple, but Viśākhā remained in the
open air. The Brahman, who had followed her, and had noted her characteristics and
her behaviour, marvelled greatly and began to question her, saying—
</p>
<p>“O maiden, whose daughter are you?”
</p>
<p>“I am Balamitra’s daughter.”
</p>
<p>“O maiden, be not angry if I ask you a few questions.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>She smiled at first, and then said, “O uncle, why should I be angry? Please to ask
them.”
</p>
<p>“While these girls, as they went, were all running, skipping, rolling, turning round,
singing, and doing other undignified things, you wended your way slowly, decorously,
and in a seemly manner, reaching the park together with them.”
</p>
<p>Viśākhā replied, “All girls are a merchandise which their parents vend. If in leaping
or rolling I were to break an arm or a leg, who then would woo me? I should certainly
have to be kept by my parents as long as I lived.”
</p>
<p>“Good, O maiden; I understand.”
</p>
<p>He said to her next, “These girls took off their clothes at a certain place, and went
into the water and sported in it unclothed, but you lifted up your clothes by degrees
as you went deeper into the water.”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, it is necessary that women should be shame-faced and shy, and so it would
not be well that any one should look upon me unclothed.”
</p>
<p>“O maiden, who would see you there?”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, you would have seen me there yourself.”
</p>
<p>“Good, O maiden; that also I comprehend.”
</p>
<p>He said to her further, “These girls first took food themselves and then gave to the
persons in attendance; but you first gave food to the persons in attendance, and then
took your own.”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, that was for this reason: we, reaping the fruits of our merits, constantly
have feast-days; but they, reaping the fruits of their trouble, very seldom obtain
great things.”
</p>
<p>“Good, O maiden; I comprehend this also.”
</p>
<p>He asked her, moreover, “While all the world wears boots on dry land, why did you
keep yours on in the water?”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, the world is foolish. It is precisely when one is in water that one should
wear boots.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>“For what reason?”
</p>
<p>“On dry land one can see tree-stems, thorns, stones, prickles, fragments of fish-scales
or shells of reptiles, but in the water none of these things can be seen. Therefore
we ought to wear boots in the water and not upon dry land.”
</p>
<p>“Good, O maiden; this also I understand.”
</p>
<p>Then he asked her this question: “These girls kept their parasols up in the sun; you
kept yours up in the wood under the shade of the trees. What was the meaning of that?”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, the world is foolish. It is precisely when in a wood that one must keep
a parasol up.”
</p>
<p>“For what reason?”
</p>
<p>“Because a wood is always full of birds and monkeys. The birds let fall their droppings
and pieces of bones, and the monkeys their muck and scraps of the fruit they eat.
Besides, as they are of a wild nature, they go springing from bough to bough, and
bits of wood come falling down. When one is in the open this does not happen, or,
if it takes place, it is but seldom. Therefore a parasol must be kept open in a wood;
in the open it is not necessary to do so.”
</p>
<p>“Good, O maiden; this also I comprehend.”
</p>
<p>Presently he said, “These girls took refuge in a temple when the wind arose with rain,
but you remained in the open air.”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, one certainly ought to remain in the open air and not take refuge in a temple.”
</p>
<p>“O maiden, what is the reason for that?”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, such empty temples are never free from orphans, bastards, and sharpers.
If one of them were to touch me on a limb or joint as I entered such a temple, would
not that be unpleasant to my parents? Moreover, it is better to lose one’s life in
the open than to enter an empty temple.”
</p>
<p>Full of delight at the demeanour of the maiden, the Brahman betook himself to the
dwelling of the householder <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>Balamitra and said, desiring to obtain the maiden, “May it be well! May it be good!”
</p>
<p>The people of the house said, “O Brahman, it is not yet the time for asking; but what
do you ask for?”
</p>
<p>“I ask for your daughter.”
</p>
<p>“On whose behalf?”
</p>
<p>“On behalf of the son, Viśākha by name, of Mṛgadhara, the first minister of Śrāvastī.”
</p>
<p>They replied, “It is true that we and he are of the same caste, but his country lies
too far away.”
</p>
<p>The Brahman said, “It is precisely in a far-away country that a man should choose
a husband for his daughter.”
</p>
<p>“How so?”
</p>
<p>“If she is married in the neighbourhood, joy increases when news comes that she is
prosperous; but if a misfortune occurs, a man’s property may be brought to nought,
he being exhausted by gifts, sacrifices, and tokens of reverence.”
</p>
<p>They said, “This being so, we will give our daughter.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the Brahman, having uttered a wish for a happy result, returned to Śrāvastī,
and there, after recovering from the fatigue of the journey, went to see the minister,
Mṛgadhara, and described to him the maiden’s youth, beauty, and intelligence, as well
as her demeanour and manner of eating. Then he said, “With great toil have I wandered
through many lands and cities, and with much trouble have I found her. Now go and
fetch her.”
</p>
<p>The first minister, Mṛgadhara, took note of the day and hour, and found that the stars
were propitious. Then he set forth and fetched away Viśākhā with great pomp as his
son’s spouse. The mother gave her daughter, when she was leaving for her husband’s
land, the following counsel: “O daughter, always honour the sun and the moon, pay
attention to the fire, wipe dirt off the mirror, and wear white clothes. You shall
take but not give. You shall keep your word. When you rise up, you shall yield your
<span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>place to none. You shall partake of savoury food. You shall sleep tranquilly. You
shall apply a ladder.”
</p>
<p>When Mṛgadhara heard this, he thought that the girl had received a quite wrong piece
of advice, and that he must dissuade her from following it and give her proper directions.
The loving mother, with troubled heart and eyes full of tears, embraced her daughter,
and said with sorrowful voice, “O daughter, this is the last time that I shall see
you.”
</p>
<p>Viśākhā replied by way of admonition, “O mother, were you born here? Is not the maiden
rather born in the house of her relatives? Is that house your home? Is it not rather
this one here? Although I was born here, I shall live there. As that which unites
undoubtedly underlies separation, be pleased not to wail but rather to keep silence.”
</p>
<p>After that Mṛgadhara went his way.
</p>
<p>Viśākhā and her husband with the attendants from her house went on board a ship. Soon
afterwards a mare which had thrown a foal was to be brought on board the ship. As
it felt that its foal would be restless on land, it resisted, and could not be got
on board. This gave rise to much noise. When Viśākhā heard it she asked what was the
cause. Being told how it arose, she gave directions that the foal should be brought
on board first, in which case the mare would follow of its own accord. Her orders
were obeyed, and the mare went on board. Mṛgadhara asked the men why they had come
so late.
</p>
<p>“Because the mare would not come on board.”
</p>
<p>“Then how was it induced to come?”
</p>
<p>“It did so after the Champā maiden had told us how to manage, and we had embarked
the foal before the mare.”
</p>
<p>“The Champā maiden is wise.”
</p>
<p>On their way, the travellers had on one occasion chosen their quarters for the night,
and Mṛgadhara’s tent was pitched under the projecting part of a hill. When Viśākhā
saw it she asked to whom it belonged. “To Mṛgadhara,” <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>was the reply. “Move it away from there,” she said. “Why should it be moved?” “Because,”
she replied, “if the projecting part of the hill were to fall while he was asleep,
he would certainly be crushed to death. Then I should all my life be exposed to the
annoyance of having people say that my husband married a wife, whose father-in-law
died on the way before she entered his house.”
</p>
<p>After the bed had been moved away the projecting mass of the hill fell down. A great
crowd came running together, full of anxiety lest the householder should have been
crushed. But he exclaimed, “Honoured sirs, here am I; be not afraid, but look after
my bed.” “It has been removed,” was the reply. “Who did that?” he asked. “Viśākhā,”
they replied. He said, “The Champā maiden is wise.”
</p>
<p>Later on, when they had taken up their quarters in an old park, and Mṛgadhara’s couch
had been prepared in an empty temple, Viśākhā saw it and asked whose it was. “That
is the master’s couch,” was the reply. “Move it away,” she said. “Why so?” “Because,”
she replied, “if the temple were to fall down he would be crushed to death, and trouble
would come upon me.”
</p>
<p>After the couch had been removed the temple fell down, and people came running up,
and so forth as before.
</p>
<p>By and by they reached Śrāvastī, and after they had recovered from the fatigues of
the journey and presented ornaments to friends, relatives, and connections, Viśākhā
began to attend to the domestic affairs of the family. As Mṛgadhara’s daughters-in-law
took it in turns to look after the food for the household, Viśākhā received instructions
to provide it on the seventh day. As the time drew near for her turn to come, she
daily rolled into pellets and desiccated what remained over of the perfumes used by
her husband and his parents. Of the powder which she thus each day obtained she took
some out of the box; the rest she mixed with oil and divided it into equal <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>portions. When her turn came next day, she took care that spirituous liquors were
prepared, and she renewed the freshness of her own and her husband’s faded garlands.
When the morning came, she bestowed upon the labourers oranges, perfumes, flowers,
and meat and drink. They were greatly pleased, and thought that, after a long time,
the householder’s old wife had looked after them. And in the course of the day they
did a double amount of work.
</p>
<p>When Mṛgadhara inspected the work towards evening and saw that much had been done,
he asked if additional day-labourers had been employed. Being told that this was not
the case, he asked what the reason was that a double amount of work had been accomplished.
The reply was, “O master, as is the food so is the labour.” “What is the meaning of
that?” he asked. Whereupon a full account was given to him of how everything had come
to pass.
</p>
<p>Mṛgadhara’s sons spoke about this to their wives, who said, “If we, like Viśākhā,
were to steal things from the house and thereby give pleasure to the day-labourers,
the master and the labourers would be pleased with us too.” Whereupon Mṛgadhara said
to Viśākhā, “O daughter, in what manner did you prepare the food?” She told him all
about it. Mṛgadhara was much pleased, asked her to manage the affairs of the household,
and ordered all the people of the house to perform, according to Viśākhā’s wishes,
whatsoever tasks she might allot to them. She thus became the mistress of the house,
and as she was excellent in her behaviour and in her whole nature, all the people
of the house rejoiced.
</p>
<p>At another time it happened that some geese from Uttarakurudvīpa flew over the house,
carrying rice which had grown without any ploughing or sowing having taken place.
The geese in Rājagṛha saw them and cackled, and they in their turn cackled, not being
able to subdue the force of instinct, so that some of the ears of rice fell on <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>the roofs of Rājagṛha. The king distributed them among the ministers, and Mṛgadhara
gave his share to Viśākhā. She placed them in a box and afterwards handed them over
to the husbandmen. They were greatly pleased, and prepared a small field for them.
And after it had been sowed with their seed at the fitting time and the deity had
sent down rain, there grew up splendid rice, answering to the seed. Next year, moreover,
they had a very abundant harvest, and in the following year a still more abundant
one. Consequently all the granaries were filled with the rice brought by the geese.
</p>
<p>When it came to pass that Prasenajit, the king of Kośala, was attacked by an illness,
and all the physicians were summoned and consulted, they gave it as their opinion
that if some of the rice brought by the geese could be found, and soup were to be
made of it, and the king were to partake thereof, in that case he would recover. So
the king called the ministers together, and asked them what they had done with the
ears of rice which the geese had brought, and which he had given to them. Some of
them said, “O king, we gave them to the temple;” and others, “We threw them into the
fire;” or others, “We fastened them up in the vestibule.” But Mṛgadhara said, “I gave
them to Viśākhā. I will inquire what she has done with them.” When he asked Viśākhā
she replied, “O master, does some one wish to partake of the geese-brought rice?”
</p>
<p>“As the king is ill, the doctors have prescribed for him the rice which the geese
brought hither.”
</p>
<p>Then Viśākhā filled a golden vase with the geese-brought rice and sent it to the king.
The king ate thereof and recovered.
</p>
<p>On another occasion some country folks came bringing a mare and her foal. As they
could not tell which was the mare and which the foal, the king ordered the ministers
to examine them closely, and to report to him on the matter. The ministers examined
them both for a whole day, became <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>weary, and arrived at no conclusion after all. When Mṛgadhara went home in the evening,
Viśākhā touched his feet and said, “O master, wherefore do ye return so late?” He
told her everything that had occurred. Then Viśākhā said, “O master, what is there
to investigate in that? Fodder should be laid before them in equal parts. The foal,
after rapidly eating up its own share, will begin to devour its mother’s also; but
the mother, without eating, will hold up her head like this. That is the proper test.”
</p>
<p>Mṛgadhara told this to the ministers, who applied the test according to these instructions,
and after daybreak they reported to the king, “This is the mother, O king, and that
is the foal.” The king asked how they knew that.
</p>
<p>“O king, the case is so and so.”
</p>
<p>“How was it you did not know that yesterday?”
</p>
<p>“O king, how could we know it? Viśākhā has instructed us since.”
</p>
<p>Said the king, “The Champā maiden is wise.”
</p>
<p>It happened that a man who was bathing had left his boots on the bank. Another man
came up, tied the boots round his head, and began to bathe likewise. When the first
man had done bathing and came out of the water, he missed the boots. The other man
said, “Hey, man, what are you looking for?”
</p>
<p>“My boots.”
</p>
<p>“Where are your boots? When you have boots, you should tie them round your head, as
I do, before going into the water.”
</p>
<p>As a dispute arose between the two men as to whom the boots belonged to, they both
had recourse to the king. The king told the ministers to investigate the case thoroughly,
and to give the boots to the proper owner. The ministers began to investigate the
case, and examined first the one man and then the other. Each of the men affirmed
that he was the owner. While these assertions were being made, the day came to an
end, and in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>evening the ministers returned home wearied out, without having brought the matter
to a satisfactory conclusion. Viśākhā questioned Mṛgadhara, and he told her all about
it, whereupon she said, “O master, what is there to investigate? Say to one of them,
‘Take one of the boots,<span class="corr" id="xd31e2901" title="Not in source">’</span> and to the other man, ‘Take the other boot.’ The real owner will say in that case,
‘Why should my two boots be separated?’ But the other, the man to whom they do not
really belong, will say, ‘What good do I gain by this if I only get one boot?’ That
is the proper test to apply.”
</p>
<p>Mṛgadhara went and told this to the ministers, and so forth, as is written above,
down to the words, “The king said, ‘The Champā maiden is wise.’ ”
</p>
<p>It happened that some merchants brought a stem of sandal-wood to the king as a present,
but no one knew which was the upper end of it and which the lower. So the king ordered
his ministers to settle the question. They spent a whole day in examining the stem,
but they could make nothing of it. In the evening they returned to their homes. Mṛgadhara
again told Viśākhā all about the matter, and she said, “O master, what is there to
investigate? Place the stem in water. The root end will then sink, but the upper end
will float upwards. That is the proper test.”
</p>
<p>Mṛgadhara communicated this to the ministers, and so forth, as is written above, down
to the words, “The king said, ‘The Champā maiden is wise.’ ”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>There was a householder in a hill-village who, after he had married in his own rank,
remained without either son or daughter. As he longed earnestly for a child, he took
unto himself a concubine. Thereupon his wife, who was of a jealous disposition, had
recourse to a spell for the purpose of rendering that woman barren. But as that woman
was quite pure, she became with child, and at the end of nine months bare a son. Then
she reflected thus: <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>“As the worst of all enmities is the enmity between a wife and a concubine, and the
stepmother will be sure to seek for a means of killing the child, what ought my husband,
what ought I to do? As I shall not be able to keep it alive, I had better give it
to her.”
</p>
<p>After taking counsel with her husband, who agreed with her in the matter, she said
to the wife, “O sister, I give you my son; take him.” The wife thought, “As she who
has a son ranks as the mistress of the house, I will bring him up.”
</p>
<p>After she had taken charge of the boy the father died. A dispute arose between the
two women as to the possession of the house, each of them asserting that it belonged
to her. They had recourse to the king. He ordered his ministers to go to the house
and to make inquiries as to the ownership of the son. They investigated the matter,
but the day came to an end before they had brought it to a satisfactory conclusion.
In the evening they returned to their homes. Viśākhā again questioned Mṛgadhara, who
told her everything. Viśākhā said, “What need is there of investigation? Speak to
the two women thus: ‘As we do not know to which of you two the boy belongs, let her
who is the strongest take the boy.’ When each of them has taken hold of one of the
boy’s hands, and he begins to cry out on account of the pain, the real mother will
let go, being full of compassion for him, and knowing that if her child remains alive
she will be able to see it again; but the other, who has no compassion for him, will
not let go. Then beat her with a switch, and she will thereupon confess the truth
as to the whole matter. That is the proper test.”
</p>
<p>Mṛgadhara told this to the ministers, and so forth, as is written above, down to the
words, “The king said, ‘The Champā maiden is wise.’ ”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After a time Mṛgadhara fell ill. One day the physician gave him a remedy and he obtained
relief. The next day <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>the physician gave him something which was not a remedy, and he was the worse for
it. Viśākhā thought, “Why does the minister find relief one day and on the next day
feel worse?” So she examined the remedy which brought relief, and employed it again.
Then she closed the door to the physicians and treated the patient herself. Whereupon
he recovered. Mṛgadhara considered why it was that he had felt better one day and
worse the next, and that now that no physician came he had recovered, so he asked
Viśākhā, and so forth as before.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Prasenajit, king of Kośala, had an overseer of elephants named Śrīvardhana. The king
reprimanded him one day. When Viśākhā heard of that she said to Mṛgadhara, “O master,
it is right that Śrīvardhana should be pardoned.” He replied, “O daughter, do you
bring about the pardon.” Thereupon she said to the king, “O king, Śrīvardhana has
been guilty of an error. Be pleased to forgive him.<span class="corr" id="xd31e2928" title="Not in source">”</span> The king forgave him.
</p>
<p>“O king, if you forgive him, be pleased to restore him his position.”
</p>
<p>The king did so. Śrīvardhana knew that he had Viśākhā to thank for his pardon, and
he resolved to make a return for that.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>At another time Mṛgadhara was attacked by a disease of the private parts, and he was
ashamed to let Viśākhā treat him for it. She said to herself, “Wherefore is the master
ashamed? May not a daughter nurse her father? Still he is ashamed.” Then she thought
that, as he would not let himself be nursed by her, he must take to himself a wife.
So she betook herself to Śrīvardhana’s house, and there, after a greeting, took a
seat. Śrīvardhana, who had one daughter, bade her touch Viśākhā’s feet, but Viśākhā
said, “Rather ought I to touch your feet.” And she added thereto, “May it be well!
may it be well!” Thereupon Śrīvardhana inquired what it was she asked for.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>“For your daughter.”
</p>
<p>“On behalf of whom?”
</p>
<p>“Of my father-in-law.”
</p>
<p>He said nothing in reply.
</p>
<p>Śrīvardhana’s wife asked what there was to prevent her being given to him.
</p>
<p>“O good wife, as we owe a debt of gratitude to Viśākhā, let her be given.”
</p>
<p>“Such being the case, we will give her.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Mṛgadhara, with great pomp, took her to himself as his wife. After which
she, and not Viśākhā, nursed him.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Mṛgadhara once said to Viśākhā, “Answer, O daughter.” She said, “O master, have I
done anything wrong?”
</p>
<p>“O daughter, have you not utterly neglected to obey the directions which your mother
gave you?”
</p>
<p>“O master, I have obeyed them all. Inasmuch as the words, ‘Honour the sun and the
moon,’ signify that the father-in-law and the mother-in-law must be considered by
the daughter-in-law as the sun and the moon, therefore have I testified my respect
for those relatives. Inasmuch as the words, ‘Pay attention to the fire,’ signify that
the husband ought to be valued by the wife like fire, impossible to be too well cared
for and fostered, therefore have I taken care of my husband as one would of the fire.
Inasmuch as the words, ‘Wipe the mirror clean,’ signify that the house ought to be
swept and cleansed like a mirror, therefore have I cleansed the house every day. The
words, ‘Wear white clothes,’ signify that when one is engaged in housework one wears
other clothes, but must put on white clothes for a sacrifice or when about to pass
into the husband’s presence; to all this I have paid attention. The words, ‘You shall
take but not give,’ signify that one should never say a bad word to any one. In this
matter also I have followed my instructions. The words, ‘Take heed to your speech,’
signify that no secret <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>ought to be divulged. To this also I have adhered. The words, ‘When you stand up,
yield not your place to any other person,’ amount to this: ‘As you are a becoming
daughter-in-law, you must sit in a special place.’ And I have sat apart. The words,
‘Eat savoury meats,’ mean that one should eat when one has become very hungry. I have
never taken any food until after giving theirs to the household. The words, ‘You shall
sleep softly,’ mean that at night, after all the household work is finished and all
implements put away, as there is no need of staying up, one should sleep. I have acted
accordingly, always reflecting that this thing was well done and that thing badly.
The words, ‘You shall apply a ladder,’ have this meaning. Like as one who, having
in an earlier state followed the path of the ten virtuous works, has arrived among
the gods, so must you, born here in the human world, attain to that by deeds, bestowing
gifts, gaining merits, and avoiding sins. This treasure-ladder is like unto a staircase
to heaven. All this also have I followed as well as I could.”
</p>
<p>“Excellent, Viśākhā, excellent! Your mother is a wise mother; and as you have guessed
the meaning of what your mother said enigmatically, you are still wiser than she.”
</p>
<p>Then Mṛgadhara thought, “If Bhagavant allows it, I will call Viśākhā my mother.” Going
to Bhagavant, he touched his feet and said, “O worthy of reverence, is it allowable
for a man to call his daughter-in-law his mother?” Bhagavant replied, “If she has
five qualities. If she is a nurse to the sick, if she lives in wedlock as a decorous
wife, if she protects living creatures, if she is a good guardian of property, and
if she has inherited wisdom—in that case she may be called mother.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Mṛgadhara went to King Prasenajit of Kośala and asked for leave to call
Viśākhā his mother. The king said, “As Viśākhā has taken care of me also, I will,
after consulting my grandmother, call her my sister.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>So he asked his grandmother, and she said that he might justly call Viśākhā by that
name.
</p>
<p>King Araṇemi Brahmadatta had become attached to the daughter of a servant-maid, and
that attachment had resulted in the birth of a son, to whom the name of Balamitra
was given. Balamitra was banished from the country by his grandfather on account of
an offence, and he went to Champā. As Viśākhā was his daughter, she might well be
called Prasenajit’s sister.
</p>
<p>The king gave orders that Viśākhā should be set upon an elephant, and that public
proclamation should be made that she, Viśākhā, was Mṛgadhara’s mother and King Prasenajit’s
sister. In what had been a park she built a monastery, and made it over to the community
of Bhikshus of the four parts of the world. Accordingly it is stated by the Sthaviras
in the Sūtras that the Buddha Bhagavant abode at Śrāvastī in the palace of Mṛgadhara’s
mother Viśākhā, in what had been the park (Pūrvārāma).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2965src" href="#xd31e2965">2</a>
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>At another time Viśākhā produced thirty-two eggs. When Mṛgadhara heard of it, he sat
for some time absorbed in meditation, resting his head upon his hand. He was inclined
to throw away this mass produced by the fairest in the land. But Viśākhā said, “O
master, throw them not away, but ask Bhagavant.” He did so, and Bhagavant said that
they were not to be thrown away, but that thirty-two cages were to be made and filled
with cotton, and that an egg was to be placed in each of the cages, and was to be
daily stroked three times with the hand, and that on the seventh day thirty-two sons
would come to light. When Viśākhā had done all this, thirty-two boys made their appearance
on the seventh day. All of them, when they grew up, were sturdy, very strong, and
overcomers of strength.
</p>
<p>One day when they had gone out to drive in their <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>chariot and were returning home, they came into collision with the chariot of the
Purohita’s son, who had also driven out and was on his way back, so that the poles
of the two carriages clashed. The Purohita’s son called out to them to make way, but
they bade him do so himself. Then, as the Purohita’s son began to use abusive language,
Viśākhā’s sons seized the pole of his chariot and upset him on a heap of rubbish.
When he had come to his father, with his robe drawn over his head, he said with tears,
“O father, thus have Viśākhā’s sons treated me.”
</p>
<p>“O son, wherefore have they done so?”
</p>
<p>The son gave a full account of the matter. Then said his father, “O son, as this is
so, we must contrive some means for making these men keep their mouths shut and not
complain.” So he carefully sought for a pretext for calumniating them.
</p>
<p>After a time the hillmen rebelled against King Prasenajit, who sent a general against
them, but he was beaten by the rebels and he turned back. After the king had in this
way sent out the general seven times, and the general was always beaten and obliged
to retire, the king determined to take the field himself with a fourfold army. Viśākhā’s
sons, as they came into the city, saw the king, and asked him whither he was going.
</p>
<p>“To subdue the hillmen.”
</p>
<p>“O king, stay here. We will go forth.”
</p>
<p>“Do so.”
</p>
<p>The king let them go forth with the fourfold army, and they overcame the hillmen,
took from them hostages and tribute, and then came back. Then the Purohita said, “O
king, as these men are of remarkably great strength, reflect that they will accomplish
what ought to be done only at the king’s command.”
</p>
<p>As kings are afraid of being killed, the king took this to heart, and once more asked
the Purohita what was to be done. The Purohita said, “What is to be done, O king?
If these men desire it, they can deprive you of <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>your regal power and exercise it themselves.” The king, greatly incensed, considered
how, if that was going to be the case, he could put them to death. He wished to contrive
a means of doing so, but was anxious that the secret should not be betrayed, and so
he resolved to undertake the affair without asking any one about it.
</p>
<p>Having come to this conclusion, he determined to invite them to his palace and rid
himself of them. He informed Viśākhā that her sons would eat with him on the following
day. Viśākhā thought, “As my sons are to eat to-morrow at their uncle’s, I will entertain
Bhagavant and the clergy.”
</p>
<p>So she betook herself to Bhagavant and touched his feet. He gratified her with discourse
regarding the doctrine. When Viśākhā rose from her seat, she invited Bhagavant and
the clergy into her house.
</p>
<p>The king’s messenger invited her sons to come to the palace. Now the king had caused
a strong poison to be put into the food. When they were stupefied thereby, he ordered
their heads to be cut off.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In olden times Janaka ruled as king in the land of Videhā. He took unto himself a
beautiful spouse, who bore him a son, to whom, as food and drink were abundant in
the land, the name of Annapāna [Food-Drink] was given. When he had grown up, he proved
strong, resolute, and irascible. The queen became arrogant on account of her son,
and no longer complied with the king’s wishes. This greatly troubled the king, and
he, by the advice of his ministers, determined to choose another wife. The ministers
called his attention to the daughter of the king of Aparāntaka. Although he was not
on friendly terms with that king, his ministers gave him encouragement, and undertook
to arrange the matter. The king of Aparāntaka granted his daughter, on the condition
that if she gave birth to a son, that son was to be recognised as the heir to the
throne. Her loveliness made her very agreeable to the king, and he promised her the
fulfilment of her wishes. So she likewise demanded that the son whom she expected
should enjoy the succession to the throne. To the king this was as it were a stab
in the heart, and he suffered great disquiet at the thought of how he should pass
over Annapāna, his bold and comely son, the fruit of a marriage with one of equal
birth. The ministers remarked his anxiety, and he informed them of its cause. They
stated that as the king of Aparāntaka had granted his daughter only on this condition,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>and as it was as yet uncertain whether she would give birth to a son or a daughter,
King Janaka ought to grant her the desired promise.
</p>
<p>A son was born, to whom the name of Rājyābhinanda was given, on account of the longing
for royal power which had been entertained even before his birth. He grew up, but
still his father did not proclaim him his successor. At length the youth’s grandfather
sent a message to King Janaka, and threatened to make his appearance with a mighty
army. The ministers recommended that Rājyābhinanda should be proclaimed successor,
and that Annapāna should be put to death. Janaka refused to comply with such a demand.
Murderers of fathers, it was true, had been met with, but it was an unheard of thing
that a father should kill his son. Nor would he consent to his being mutilated, that
being equivalent to death. As little would he agree to his being banished; but he
invested the younger prince with the right of succession.
</p>
<p>When Annapāna heard of this, he went to his mother, informed her of the evil tidings,
and told her that he was about to go to Panchāla. And thither he went. With wearied
limbs he lay down to rest in the shade of a tree. There the king’s people found him.
Astonished by his beauty, they brought him to the king, to whom he told the story
of his fortunes. The king gave him the hand of his daughter, and bestowed lands upon
him. The son who was born of this marriage was named Bahvannapāna.
</p>
<p>Annapāna fell ill and died, and the king gave his daughter, along with her son, to
the Purohita, with whom she lived happily. One day a cock crowed near the house. A
Brahman who happened to be there, and who was skilled in omens, heard it crow and
said, “He who eats the flesh of this cock will become king.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3012src" href="#xd31e3012">2</a> The <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>Purohita heard these words, and, after asking the Brahman some questions, took the
cock and killed it. Then he said to his wife, “Have this cock cooked immediately.
I will eat it when I come back from the king’s palace.” Then he betook himself to
the palace.
</p>
<p>While he was there, the boy Bahvannapāna came back from school hungry, and could not
find his mother. He said to himself, “What has been cooked for us? what sort of food?”
In his mother’s absence he looked about, and saw the cock in a saucepan with its head
uppermost. So he cut off the head and ate it. His mother came in presently and said,
“Who has eaten the head?” The boy replied that he had eaten it. His mother gave him
some food and sent him to school.
</p>
<p>After a time the Purohita also came and asked for food. When he saw that the cock’s
head had disappeared, he asked where it was. His wife said, “The boy has eaten it.”
He ate up the rest of the cock, but remained in doubt as to which of the two would
become king, he who had eaten the bird’s whole body, or he who had eaten only a bird
incomplete as to the parts of its body. In order to remove this doubt, he called in
for the second time the Brahman who was skilled in omens. The Brahman asserted that
he who had eaten the head would become king, but that he also would become king who
should kill him who had eaten the head, and should eat his head.
</p>
<p>Therefore the Purohita determined to put the boy to death. But as he saw that he could
not do this without the boy’s mother remarking it, he resolved to take her opinion
about the matter. With many friendly words he addressed her in a cajoling manner:
“O good one, is it better that your husband or your son should become king?” Quickly
recognising the complicated nature of <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>the situation, she reflected that if she said it would be better for her son to become
king, she would be at variance with her husband. So she said, in accordance with his
view of the matter, that it would be better for her husband to become king. But as
she was very shrewd and intelligent, she perceived that he wished to kill her son
on account of the cock’s head, and she determined to save her son at any rate. So
she told her son that, as he had acted wrongly in eating the cock’s head, he must
leave the country with all speed, and betake himself to his grandfather’s land, where
he had relatives. The son fled to Videha, and there, tormented with hunger and thirst,
he lay down one day in order to sleep under a tree in a park.
</p>
<p>A little before that time Rājyābhinanda had been attacked by a malady of which, in
spite of the efforts of the physicians, he could not be cured. He succumbed to it,
and thereby was the reigning family brought to an end.
</p>
<p>Now it was part of the royal statutes that until a new king had been chosen the corpse
of the late king could not be honoured with funeral ceremonies. Accordingly the ministers,
the other officials of the court, the Brahmans, and the interpreters of signs, set
out to look for a person distinguished by the force of his virtuous merits. Under
a tree outside the city, a tree the shadow of which never moved from his body, they
found an extremely handsome youth with a lion-like breast. When the six ministers
had looked at him, they exclaimed in astonishment, “Never have we seen any one who
equalled this man in force of virtuous merit. As he is extremely handsome, and is
well provided with signs, we will invest him with the sovereignty.” Having thus spoken,
and having agreed thereupon, they aroused him from his sleep. He awoke and asked,
“Why must I get up?” They replied, “In order to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>proclaimed king.” He said, “Ought a slumbering king to be awakened in this manner?”
The ministers said, “How then ought he to be awakened?” The youth replied, “He ought
to be awakened with song and cymbals and beat of drum.” On hearing this, they came
to the conclusion that he truly sprang, not from an inferior, but from a noble family,
and they asked him, “Who are you? whose noble son are you?” Then the youth rose up
lion-like and said, “Annapāna was the son of Janaka, king of Videha, and I am Annapāna’s
son, Bahvannapāna.” Thereupon the six ministers smiled and said, “We have actually
lighted upon our own prince.”
</p>
<p>In the midst of a great multitude, with conjurations, and with song and cymbals and
beat of drum, they conducted him into the city, and there they consecrated him as
king. As the extinct royal family was renewed in him, he also received the name of
Janaka, and his former name of Bahvannapāna fell into disuse. After they had thus
invested him with the sovereignty, they came to the conclusion that he was of a simple
nature, and they despised him to such a degree that he had no power at all.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>King Bahvannapāna once went forth in order to inspect his realm. Whenever he asked
to whom villages, towns, and hill-places belonged, he was always told that they belonged
to the six ministers. Thereupon he perceived that he could command only food and clothing,
but that beyond that he had no power. When he had plunged into a sea of thought, trying
to think out what he should do, a deity consoled him, saying that he ought not to
be sorrowful. In his own country, in the hill-village Pūrṇakatshtshha, a son named
Mahaushadha was about to be born to the head-man, Pūrṇa. This son he ought to make
his minister, who would gain possession of the realm and restore it to him, and turn
out fortunate <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>and advantageous to him. The king sent forth men to seek out this Pūrṇa, and to learn
whether his wife had a son or not. The men returned with the information that the
village head-man really existed, and that his wife was with child. Then the king wrote
to him and made him come to him, conferred upon him the village, and bade him henceforth
carefully watch over the child, which was as yet in its mother’s womb, so that none
of its limbs might suffer any injury. When the boy came into the world and his birth-feast
was celebrated, the name of Mahaushadha (Great Remedy) was given to him at the request
of his mother, inasmuch as she, who had long suffered from illness, and had been unable
to obtain any relief from the time of the boy’s conception, had been cured by him.
</p>
<p>As the boy was sitting on his father’s shoulder one day, and was being carried for
a bath from the middle of the street to a tank, the father saw a piece of fish lying
before him. Taking it for a precious stone, he tried to lift it up with his toes.
Then said Mahaushadha, “Dear father Pūrṇa, you think that a precious stone has been
dropped here. Gazing with open eyes at the piece of fish, you fancy that it is a precious
stone. Test it, dear father Pūrṇa. It is no precious stone; only a piece of red fish
crushed underfoot. Vaiśravaṇa<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3069src" href="#xd31e3069">3</a> is not accustomed to be so careless.”
</p>
<p>When they had come to the tank, and Pūrṇa and Mahaushadha had laid their clothes on
the bank and had gone into the water to bathe, the father wanted to lay hold of a
crane which was resting on a lotus, but when he drew near the bird flew away. Then
Mahaushadha said, “From the lotus flew the crane away. The crane flew away, the lotus
remained. Only see, father dear, how the crane flies away from the lotus.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>On another occasion the father went to the river Ganges to bathe, carrying his son
as before on his shoulder. When they had left their clothes on the shore and had gone
into the water, they saw a metal basin floating on the water with a goose sitting
upon it. Then said Mahaushadha, “The river Ganges supports the metal basin, on the
metal basin rests a goose. Look, O father dear, at the metal basin with the goose
carried along by the river Ganges.”
</p>
<p>Another time, when Mahaushadha had gone to the shore to bathe, he saw how a pot, on
which was a water-hen, was borne along by the current of the river Ganges. Then he
said, “The river Ganges bears along the pot, on the pot sits a water-hen. Only look,
father dear, at the pot with the water-hen and the Ganges.”
</p>
<p>Again, on another occasion, he saw a ram carried along by the current of the river
Ganges with a heron standing upon it, and he said, “The river Ganges bears along a
ram, and likewise the heron which stands upon it. Look, father dear, at the ram and
the heron borne along by the river Ganges.”
</p>
<p>After this it happened one day that Mahaushadha was at play with the children, and
they chose him as their king.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3080src" href="#xd31e3080">4</a> He named some of the boys as his ministers, and they went on playing together. There
came along the road an old Brahman with his young wife, on their way to another country.
The Brahman stepped aside for a time, and during his absence a rogue, full of desire
for the wife, came up to her and said, “Good woman, whither has your father gone?”
</p>
<p>“Who?” said the wife.
</p>
<p>“He is apparently your grandfather,” replied the rogue.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” she said.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>“He is apparently your great-grandfather,” said the rogue.
</p>
<p>“He is not my father, nor my grandfather, nor yet my great-grandfather, but my husband,”
said the wife.
</p>
<p>Thereupon the rogue said with a smile, “O foolish woman, are you not ashamed to say
in the presence of your friends or any other decorous person that this man is your
husband? Have you not on this stately earth seen men of divine beauty?”
</p>
<p>“Such men are no more to be found.”
</p>
<p>“Take me as your husband, and we will live together. Should the old Brahman put in
a claim for you, then say to the great assembly, ‘This man is my husband.’ ”
</p>
<p>After the rogue had said this she went off with him. When the Brahman came back, he
could not see his wife. He climbed a height, and saw her walking off with another
man. He ran after her, and seized one of her hands, the rogue holding on to the other.
The Brahman said, “Why are you taking away my wife?”
</p>
<p>“She is my wife; do not trouble yourself about her,” replied the rogue.
</p>
<p>As the Brahman persisted in saying that she was his wife, a quarrel arose between
the two men on the highway, and they pulled the woman this way and that way. But as
the rogue was younger and stronger than the Brahman, he dragged her away from him.
Being overcome, the Brahman called out in that lonely place for help. At that time
Mahaushadha and the other children were at play in the forest, and they heard his
cries for help. The children said to Mahaushadha, “As you wish to be called the king,
and that Brahman is shouting for help, why do not you save him from danger?” So he
bade the children bring the parties before him, and he asked them what had occurred.
The Brahman said that the other man had forcibly torn away his wife from him, the
weaker of the two. On the other hand, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>rogue declared that the Brahman lied, and that the woman was his own wife. The woman
herself affirmed that the rogue was her husband. Mahaushadha, who perceived that the
Brahman had not become excited without due cause, determined to apply a test.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3106src" href="#xd31e3106">5</a>
</p>
<p>“Say, O man, where do you come from along with your wife?”
</p>
<p>“From my father-in-law’s,” replied the rogue.
</p>
<p>“What did you eat and drink there?”
</p>
<p>“We had meat, cakes, sorrel, and wine,” replied the rogue.
</p>
<p>“Vomit then, if that be so,” said Mahaushadha; “we shall see then if that be true
or not.”
</p>
<p>The rogue put his finger down his throat and vomited, but no such food came to light.
Then Mahaushadha asked the Brahman whence he had come.
</p>
<p>“From my father-in-law’s,” replied the Brahman.
</p>
<p>“What did you eat there?”
</p>
<p>“Curdled milk, porridge, and radishes.”
</p>
<p>Him likewise Mahaushadha ordered to bring up what he had eaten, and the result was
that he produced the food in question. As Mahaushadha now perceived that the rogue
had deluded and carried off the Brahman’s wife, he gave orders that he should be chastised
by blows from sticks and fists, and that he should then be set fast up to the neck
in a hole a man’s stature in depth, and that there should be written on his forehead
with peacock’s gall these words—
</p>
<p>“He who thus steals a wife, him does Mahaushadha punish in this wise. He who, like
unto the wife-stealer, has stolen a child, an ox, a coverlet, yarn, or the like, such
thieves as this shall be arrested up to the number of five hundred, and shall be chastised
by blows from sticks and fists, and shall be set up to their necks in a <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>pit, and their names shall be written on their foreheads with peacock’s gall, indicating
that Mahaushadha will thus punish others also who shall commit thefts.”
</p>
<p>Now, when the six ministers had exhausted the land, and the king became aware of the
fact, the idea came into his mind of finding out of what nature Mahaushadha really
was. He told the ministers that he was going to the chase, and he went with a great
following to the hill-villages. When the five hundred rogues who had been set in the
pit saw the king, most of them cried out, “O king!” The king heard the cry, and looked
around on all sides, but he saw no man, though the cry again resounded. One of the
rogues perceived this, and repeated it. The king caught sight of him, and read on
his forehead the words written with peacock’s gall: “Whoever has stolen a wife, a
child, an ox, a coverlet, and so forth, him does Mahaushadha punish in this wise.”
When Mahaushadha and the other children heard that the king had seen these things,
his heart rejoiced within him, and he thought that although Mahaushadha was a child,
yet in regard to such deeds he had done no wrong. However, he ordered the rogues to
be drawn out of the pit, and set them at liberty.
</p>
<p>When Pūrṇa heard that the king had come to Pūrṇakatshtshha, he went to meet him, bearing
a jar full of water, a canopy, banners, and standards. The king said to him, “Pūrṇa,
be not afraid. Bring hither your son that I may see him.” Pūrṇa replied, “O king,
as the boy is still very young, I will not bring him before the face of the king.”
However the king ordered the father to fetch his boy. Then the king gazed upon the
exceedingly handsome and spirited boy; but as he was still a child, and had not come
to man’s estate, the king let him go back to his father’s house.
</p>
<p>Some time later King Janaka wished to test the nature of Mahaushadha’s intelligence.
So he sent a <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>messenger to Pūrṇa, the head-man of the hill-village Pūrṇakatshtshha, with an order
to send a rope made of sand one hundred ells long. When the messenger had arrived
and communicated the order, Pūrṇa was greatly alarmed. From his birth upwards he had
never seen or heard of such a thing, and he would therefore have to expect a reprimand.
He became so depressed that Mahaushadha asked him why he was so ill at ease. The father
replied that he was not sure that the king did not mean to punish him, the demand
being of such an unheard of kind. Mahaushadha asked him to send for the messenger,
saying that he would reply to the king. Thereupon he said to the messenger, “Make
known to the king this my request, without forgetting it. As the people of our country
are slow-witted, unintelligent, and stupid, may it please the king to send an ell
of that kind of rope as a pattern, like unto which we will twine a hundred, nay, a
thousand ells, and will send them to him.” When the messenger had reported this to
the king, the king asked whether it was Pūrṇa or his son who had given this answer.
The messenger said that it was Mahaushadha. The king was astonished, and perceived
that the commands of the deity were being executed, and that Mahaushadha would re-establish
his power.
</p>
<p>As the king wished to put Mahaushadha a second time to the test, he sent to Pūrṇa,
and ordered him to supply some rice which had not been crushed with a pestle, and
yet was not uncrushed, and which had been cooked neither in the house nor out of the
house, neither with fire nor yet without fire; sending it neither along the road nor
yet away from the road, without its being shone upon by the daylight, but yet not
in the shade, not together with a woman, but also not with a man, by one not riding,
but also not on foot. The messenger came to Pūrṇakatshtshha, sent for Pūrṇa, and,
after holding merry converse with him on various subjects, informed <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>him of the king’s orders. Pūrṇa was greatly discomfited. But Mahaushadha, having found
out the cause of his dejection, comforted him, declaring that he would manage the
whole affair himself.
</p>
<p>Having dried some rice in the sun, he sent for a number of women, and made a man give
each of them a handful of grains. These they shelled with their nails, picking out
the kernel of each grain without breaking it. When the women had done this, he threw
the rice into a pot, and cooked it on the threshold of the house. As he was to cook
it without fire and yet not without fire, he cooked it in the sun. In order that it
might be conveyed neither along the road nor yet away from the road, he ordered the
man who carried it to walk with one foot on the road and the other foot by the side
of the road. As it was to be brought neither in the sunlight nor in the shade, he
bade the man fasten the pot which held it to the end of a stick, and cover it over
with a thin cloth. As the bearer was neither to ride nor to go afoot, he told him
to put a shoe on one of his feet and leave the other unshod. And as the bearer was
to be neither a man nor a woman, he sent a hermaphrodite.
</p>
<p>When the messenger presented himself before the king, and, on being questioned by
King Janaka, gave him a full account of the whole matter, the king was greatly pleased,
and asked if he had been sent by Pūrṇa or by Mahaushadha. The messenger replied that
he had been sent by the latter, whereupon the king said, “Mahaushadha is clever, resolute,
sharp-witted, and ingenious.”
</p>
<p>Some time afterwards the king sent to Pūrṇa, and ordered him to supply a park with
kitchen-gardens, fruit-trees, and tanks. When the messenger came to Pūrṇa and told
him what were the king’s orders, Pūrṇa again fell into very low spirits. Mahaushadha
begged his father not to distress himself, promising to arrange everything to the
king’s satisfaction. Then he sent for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>messenger, and told him to give the following reply to the king:—
</p>
<p>“As no one among the mountains knows anything about a park of that kind, and therefore
no one can construct one, may it please the king to send hither one of the parks belonging
to his palace. When my father has seen it, and learnt of what nature it is, he will
send one like unto it.”
</p>
<p>When the messenger returned with this reply, the king was highly pleased, and when
he learnt that it was again Mahaushadha who had sent it, he perceived that he was
very intelligent.
</p>
<p>Some time later the king again sent a messenger to Pūrṇa, ordering him to plant a
tree, and to send it to him at the end of a year, bearing blossoms and fruits. When
the messenger had executed his commission, Pūrṇa again became dejected, but Mahaushadha
comforted him, saying that the matter would not be a difficult one to manage. And
he sent a Ricinus shrub, which at the end of a year bore blossoms and fruits. When
the king saw it, he asked whether the idea was Pūrṇa’s or Mahaushadha’s. The messenger
named the latter, and the king found nothing more to say in the matter.
</p>
<p>Some time later the king sent five hundred oxen to Pūrṇa. These he was to feed and
to milk, and he was to send to the king milk, curdled milk, butter, cream, and cheese.
When the messenger came to Pūrṇa with these orders, Pūrṇa was greatly troubled, and
said to the villagers, “Surely in this matter the king wishes to punish me, seeing
that he requires me to milk oxen.” When Mahaushadha perceived his distress, he comforted
him, saying that he would contrive a reply with which the king would be pleased without
this thing being accomplished. Then Mahaushadha gave full directions to a father and
son, ordering them to betake themselves to the capital, near the king’s palace. He
told the father <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>to wrap up a wooden bowl in a cloth and fasten it over his belly, and then to roll
to and fro on the ground and pretend to be crying. And he told the son to utter fervent
prayers, to scatter flowers, food, and incense towards the ten parts of the world,
and to cry aloud, “May this, my father, propitiously bring forth his child!”
</p>
<p>When the father and son, in accordance with these instructions, had drawn nigh unto
King Janaka, they did all that they had been told to do. When the king heard the words,
“May he who in the world protects the world preserve my father, and let him propitiously
give birth to his child!” he sent some of his men to find out what that meant. They
came, and saw a big-bellied man rolling to and fro on the ground and crying, and his
son invoking Yama, Vaiśravaṇa, Vasu, and the other kings of the gods. The men reported
this to the king, and he sent for the father and son. The son begged that his father
might be allowed to bring forth his child. Thereat the king laughed, and said that
he had never seen or heard of a man who gave birth to a child.
</p>
<p>Then said the youth, “Are things as you say they are?”
</p>
<p>“Yes!”
</p>
<p>“In that case, I ask you wherefore you sent five hundred oxen to Pūrṇakatshtshha,
with orders that milk, sour milk, curdled milk, and fresh butter should be obtained
from them. Have you ever seen or heard of oxen big with young and producing calves?”
</p>
<p>Then the king laughed, and asked who was the originator of this idea, Pūrṇa or Mahaushadha,
or <span class="corr" id="xd31e3155" title="Source: some one">someone</span> else. When the messenger stated that it was Mahaushadha, the king and his ministers
were greatly astonished.
</p>
<p>Some time later, the king, in order to apply another test, sent a messenger to Pūrṇakatshtshha
with a mule, and ordered Pūrṇa to keep watch over it without tying it up, and to feed
it without placing it under a roof. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>messenger brought the mule to Pūrṇa, and warned him that he would forfeit his life
and limbs in case the mule escaped. When Pūrṇa heard that, he was terrified and fell
into very low spirits, as he did not think he was equal to the task. But Mahaushadha
bade him be of good cheer. By day the mule was to be allowed to graze at its will,
but at night it was to be guarded by twenty men, five of whom were to look after it
during each of the night-watches, one of them sitting on its back, the others holding
a leg apiece. After this fashion the twenty men watched it without taking it under
a roof.
</p>
<p>After a time King Janaka sent a messenger to see how Pūrṇa was treating the mule.
He reported to the king the precautions which had been taken. The king perceived that
the mule could not escape while it was guarded in that way, so he said that he wished
one of the men to be sent for. The minister asked which man was to be summoned. The
king said that they were to send for the man who was sitting on the mule’s back. For
while the others were asleep he could ride off with the mule. So the king had the
watcher sent for who sat on the mule, and the man came away together with the beast.
</p>
<p>When Pūrṇa was told next morning that the mule had gone off, he saw that his life
was forfeited, and he took to wailing from fear. When Mahaushadha saw how miserable
Pūrṇa was, he began to reflect that hitherto he had found a means of escape on each
occasion, but that this time there was none. Of this, however, he said nothing. Although
he was much alarmed, yet he devised a plan, and said to his father, “There is still
one expedient left for settling this business.” His father asked what it was, and
Mahaushadha replied that he could manage the affair provided Pūrṇa could endure being
jeered at. Pūrṇa declared that he was ready to do anything which <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>would prevent his life being taken. Thereupon Mahaushadha cut the hair of his father’s
head so as to form seven strips, and he daubed the head itself with red, black, brown,
white, and other paints. Then he and his father mounted an ass and betook themselves
to the capital.
</p>
<p>When they arrived there, the news spread abroad that Mahaushadha had come riding upon
an ass, and that he had cut his father’s hair into seven strips. When the king and
the ministers heard this, they asked, “Why has he, who has the reputation of being
so discreet and intelligent, performed so unbecoming an action?” The king and the
ministers went out to see if Mahaushadha had really come in the manner alleged, or
if the report was false. When the king and his followers saw that it was really so
with him, the ministers said, “Wherefore is Mahaushadha praised for his judgment,
intelligence, and wisdom? In spite of all that, how unbecomingly he has acted!”
</p>
<p>The king asked Mahaushadha why he had thus dishonoured his father. He replied, “I
have not dishonoured him, but have honoured him. As I stand much higher than my father
on account of my great knowledge, I have shown him honour.”
</p>
<p>The king asked, “Are you the better of the two, or is your father the better?”
</p>
<p>He replied, “I am the better, my father is the worse.”
</p>
<p>The king said, “Never have I seen or heard that the son is better than the father.
As it is the father through whom the son becomes known, while the mother feeds him,
takes care of him, and brings him up, therefore we hold that the father is altogether
the better of the two.”
</p>
<p>Then said Mahaushadha to the king, “Test the matter thoroughly to see if the father
is really so or not.”
</p>
<p>As the king and the ministers affirmed that it was so, and not otherwise, Mahaushadha
fell at the king’s feet <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>and said, “O king, this being the case, as the mule which you sent us to watch over
has run away, but as according to the testimony of the king and the ministers the
father is considered better than the offspring, and the father of the mule is the
ass, accept this ass as a set-off.”
</p>
<p>When the king and the ministers had heard his speech, and perceived the cunning contrivance
which it carried out, they were astonished. Whether he had acted becomingly or unbecomingly,
it was clear that he was clever. Having thought the matter over, the king was much
pleased, and he arrayed Mahaushadha in fine robes of various kinds, and bestowed upon
him the power of a minister, and on the father he conferred that village.
</p>
<p>After Mahaushadha had been appointed a minister, his fame spread abroad throughout
the whole city as that of a wise and intelligent man.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Now a very learned Brahman had gone abroad in order to increase his property, after
he and his wife had spent all that she had brought along with her; and he returned
home with five hundred gold pieces of ancient date. Before entering his house he was
desirous of disposing of his money, for none could tell whether his wife might not
have taken up with another man during his absence. His wife was of remarkable beauty,
and therefore he considered that she might have found favour in the eyes of other
men during his absence. So in the evening twilight he went to the cemetery, dug a
hole under a Nyagrodha tree, put the money into it, and then went to his home.
</p>
<p>Now the wife had a lover, the Brahman Mahākarṇa (Great Ear). The pair had about that
time partaken of delicate food, and she had anointed herself with fragrant ointment,
and was reposing upon the couch of enjoyment. Just then came the Brahman and called
to her to open the door. The woman asked who was there. When he <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>had pronounced his name, she uttered a joyful cry, aroused Mahākarṇa, and hid him
under the bed, and then went to open the door. With thorough dissimulation she wept
and flung her arms round her husband’s neck, showed him honour and respect, and placed
savoury food before him. After partaking of it, he came to the conclusion that the
reason of her having provided such a supper must certainly be that she had given herself
up to another man. As he was of an ingenuous nature, he asked her, “O good wife, how
comes it that you have such food, seeing that this is not a holiday, a festival, or
day of public rejoicing?” She replied, “A deity made me aware that you were coming
to-day, so I provided this meal on your account.” The Brahman said, “Then it is not
I alone who am fortunate. My wife also, it seems, receives tidings from the deity
in dreams.”
</p>
<p>After he had eaten and washed, he lay down upon the bed to rest, and conversed with
his wife about her welfare. Presently she asked him if he had brought anything with
him. He said that he had. Thereupon the wife intimated by signs, “Mahākarṇa, let thine
ear listen to what is being said.” Then she said, “Where have you put the five hundred
gold pieces, as you have not shown them to me?” He replied, “I will show them to you
to-morrow.” Then said the wife, “Why have you kept the matter from me, though I am
the half of your body?” The honest Brahman said, “I have hidden the money outside
the city.” The wife said, “Hear, O Great Ear, where the money has been put.” The Brahman
said that he had hidden the money under a Nyagrodha tree in the cemetery. Then said
the Brahman’s wife, “As you, my lord, are fatigued and exhausted by the journey and
on my account, now go to sleep.”
</p>
<p>When she saw that he had gone to sleep, she bade Mahākarṇa act in accordance with
what he had heard. Mahākarṇa slipped quietly out of the house, went to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>cemetery, dug up the money, and then betook himself to his own house.
</p>
<p>When the Brahman went to the cemetery the next day, and found that his money was no
longer there, he beat himself on the head and breast, and returned home. His wife,
his friends, his brothers, and his relatives asked him what had happened, and he told
them everything. They advised him to have recourse to Mahaushadha. Then the Brahman
went wailing to Mahaushadha, his face streaming with tears, and told him his misfortune.
Mahaushadha remained silent for a moment. Then he asked, “Brahman, at what spot and
at what time did you hide the money? Did any one see it? or have you talked about
it to any one?” The Brahman gave a full account of the whole affair. Mahaushadha came
to the conclusion that the Brahman’s wife had some other man as a lover, and that
what had taken place was due to that man’s contrivance. But he spoke words of comfort
to the Brahman, saying that if the money was not found he would pay it to him out
of his own purse. Then he asked him if there was a dog in his house. The Brahman replied
that there was. Then said Mahaushadha, “Go and invite eight Brahmans to your house.
Invite four of them yourself, and let your wife invite the other four. Tell her that
you have made a vow to the god Śiva that if you should accomplish your return prosperously
you would entertain eight Brahmans.”
</p>
<p>The Brahman followed these instructions, and when the Brahmans had been invited, he
went to Mahaushadha in order to acquaint him with the fact. Then said Mahaushadha,
“When you are about to receive the Brahmans into your house, call this man of mine,
and station him at the door when they enter. And during the meal let him stand inside
without being occupied in any way.” And to his man he said, “Take note of everything
significant. When the Brahmans <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>come in, see which of them the dog barks at, and before whom it wags its tail; for
such is the nature of dogs.” Moreover, he ordered the Brahman not to set the food
before his guests with his own hands, but to leave that to his wife. He told his man
also to pay heed to the Brahman’s wife while she was serving the food, and see to
whom she made a sign, at whom she gazed without changing countenance, whom she addressed
with a smile, and to whom she served the best fare, and to make him acquainted with
all this.
</p>
<p>These instructions having been given, the Brahman took the servant home with him and
stationed him at the door. Then he told his wife to summon the guests whom she had
invited, while he summoned those whom he had invited. As the other guests entered
the house one after another, the dog barked. But when Mahākarṇa came in, the dog looked
at him, drooped its ears, wagged its tail, and followed after him. When he had entered
in and called the dog, the servant learnt that he was Mahākarṇa. Afterwards the servant
saw the food distributed, and remarked that the Brahman’s wife, while taking part
in the distribution, made a sign with her eyebrows to Mahākarṇa, smiled slightly,
fixed her eyes upon him, and supplied him with the best of the food. All that he saw
he afterwards reported to Mahaushadha.
</p>
<p>As soon as Mahaushadha heard these things, he sent for Mahākarṇa, asked him if it
was a Brahman’s business to lay hands on the property of others, and ordered him to
restore what he had stolen. Mahākarṇa said he thought that Mahaushadha ought to make
himself easy, as he, Mahākarṇa, knew nothing at all about the matter. Thereupon Mahaushadha
gave orders that the evil-doer should be thrown into prison, and left there until
his bones became visible. At this threat Mahākarṇa was so terrified that he begged
for mercy with a contrite <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>heart, promising to repay all. Going home, he fetched the money, tied up just as it
had been, and handed it over to Mahaushadha, who gave it to the Brahman. The Brahman
rejoiced greatly, and seeing that his having recovered what he had lost was entirely
due to Mahaushadha’s powerful assistance, he wished to make manifest his gratitude
to him, so he brought him half of the money as a present. Mahaushadha accepted the
present and then returned it to him. When the news of all this became spread throughout
the city, the king, the ministers, and the citizens praised Mahaushadha highly on
account of his wisdom, and esteemed themselves fortunate in having such a minister.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After a time it happened that a certain man who had gone on business into another
land came back to his own country. Having come to the edge of a tank, he opened his
meal-pouch, took out some of the meal, and mixed it with water and partook thereof.
After feeding he tied up his pouch and went his way. Now while he was sitting there
a snake had crept into the pouch, one of those snakes which emit poison when disturbed.
But when the man turned to his pouch after his repast, he tied it up without examining
it. Then he flung it across his shoulder and went on to the capital. There a soothsayer
informed him that he was in imminent danger of losing his life.
</p>
<p>Some time after he had received this information, he regretted that he had not asked
the soothsayer on what ground it was based. Having thus reflected, he determined not
to go home till he had consulted the minister Mahaushadha. When he had gone to him
and had told him the whole story, Mahaushadha came to the conclusion that the soothsayer
must certainly have given him this piece of information because his pouch contained
one of the snakes which emit poison when disturbed. Therefore <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>he bade him open his pouch with a piece of wood, in the presence of witnesses, but
in some retired place. In that case he would soon learn the ground in question. The
man did so, and when the poisonous snake lifted up its head, breathed furiously, and
made its outstretched tongue vibrate, Mahaushadha said, “That is the danger by which
you were threatened.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After a time Mahaushadha equipped a complete army and went out to take a survey of
the land. Whenever he asked to whom the different villages, towns, and cities belonged,
the inhabitants replied that they belonged to this or that minister. Then Mahaushadha
perceived that the six ministers had in this manner taken possession of the whole
country, and that King Janaka’s rule was restricted to his own food and drink. He
asked the king who really was the master of the villages, hill-towns, and cities.
The king related to him how the merciful gods had informed him that in the village
Pūrṇakatshtshha a son named Mahaushadha was about to be born to Pūrṇa, and that he,
the king, would make Mahaushadha his first minister, who would recover for him all
his power, by which means he would become possessed of complete regal authority.
</p>
<p>“Therefore [continued the king] have I provided you with all things necessary while
you were still in your mother’s womb, and from that time forth, and have raised you
to the rank of first minister. Now by the force of your intelligence shall you fulfil
the words of the deity and help me to gain my supremacy.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Mahaushadha paid honour to the king, and bade him take courage, saying that
he would act in such a way that the king would be well pleased. Accordingly he sent
for the head-men of the villages, towns, and cities one after another, and assured
them that he would arrange matters in such a way that they would be satisfied with
<span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>him. Much harm had been done to them by those ministers, who had levied out of covetousness
immoderate rates and taxes. If they would act in accordance with his instructions,
he would be mindful thereof, and would fix moderate taxes, set all other things in
order, and help them to secure their welfare. In any case, they ought to revolt, and
when the king came with the other ministers, they ought to say that they would not
submit until the minister Mahaushadha should come, but that when he came, they would
obey him but no one else.
</p>
<p>When he had given them these instructions, and had stirred up the people in all those
parts and instigated them to rebellion, so that they recalled their allegiance, the
other ministers petitioned the king, and King Janaka sent forth those six ministers
together with a great army; but they did not succeed in getting possession of a single
village or hill-town. So they sent a messenger to the king with the statement that
they could not enforce submission unless the king came himself; but the king also
could not obtain the submission of a single hill-town. So, as many men had fallen
in battle, the king and the ministers became dejected. Then said the inhabitants of
the hill-villages, “If the first minister Mahaushadha were to come, we would obey
him and submit ourselves to him. We have not rebelled against King Janaka, but we
have behaved as we have done because the ministers have wrought us injury.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the king sent a messenger to Mahaushadha, saying, “As we cannot reduce the
land to submission, do you come hither.” When Mahaushadha had looked at the king’s
letter, he went at once to the king. When the people of that land saw him, they all
paid reverence to him, and he spoke words of encouragement to them, and fixed their
taxes according to law, and succoured the poor and lowly and helpless. To the townspeople
and the country-folk he gave presents, greeting and embracing <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>them as if they were his parents, brothers, and kinsmen. The old men of the land,
and the young people and the women, looked upon him as a son or a brother. To all
of them he gave great satisfaction; and then, after he had finally united all the
lands together, he went back to the seat of royalty, together with King Janaka. By
means of these deeds he gained an honoured reputation among other kings also. King
Janaka was so highly pleased that he gave his daughter in marriage to Mahaushadha,
who lived with her happily.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After a time there came unto King Janaka a king<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3228src" href="#xd31e3228">6</a> who had lost his possessions. As King Janaka did not care for him, he betook himself
to Mahaushadha, who received him with compassion and supplied him with means of subsistence.
</p>
<p>Some time afterwards a Brahman came to Mahaushadha and asked him for a measure of
barley. Mahaushadha promised it to him, but intrusted the delivery of it to the overseer
of the granary, who kept putting the matter off from day to day and gave nothing.
</p>
<p>Now it came to pass one day that the king was sitting surrounded by the ministers
and the town and country folk at a certain spot where many people paid reverence to
him. He asked the ministers to what person a secret might be intrusted, on whom it
might be safe to rely. The ministers began to consider. One of them said that a man
might intrust a secret to his friend; another, to his wife; a third, to his mother;
a fourth, to his sister; a fifth, to his brother. When Mahaushadha was asked by the
king why he did not in his turn express an opinion, he replied, “O king, my opinion
is that a man ought not to intrust a secret to any one, but least of all to his wife.
This will I prove unto you, O king.”
</p>
<p>Some time after this the king’s peacock was missing. <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>Mahaushadha found it but hid it away. Then he took another which resembled it and
said to his wife, “Have you heard that the king’s peacock up at the palace is missing?”
She replied that she had heard about it. Then Mahaushadha said to her, “Say nothing
about it to any one, but cook it quickly, and I will eat it.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3237src" href="#xd31e3237">7</a> She said to herself, “See now, this man from the hill-village wants to eat the king’s
peacock. My father places the utmost confidence in him, and he acts to the king’s
hurt.”
</p>
<p>Some time afterwards, Mahaushadha dressed<span id="xd31e3243"></span> in full array a courtesan who bore a likeness to one of the king’s wives, and brought
her to his wife. And he said to his wife, “This is such and such a wife of the king’s.
As I am very intimate with her, and you are dear to me, do not mention it to any one.”
Thinking that she and Mahaushadha were living together, the king’s daughter became
very angry. And she considered that as he was dishonouring her father, who was quite
unaware thereof, it was not right to appoint as first minister a man sprung from a
lowly family in a hill-village, and to intrust the whole of the king’s affairs to
him, the shameful one. So with a view to seeing that he was put back again into his
former place, she went to her father and said, “O father, you have unadvisedly appointed
this miscreant first minister, and you placed reliance upon him in an unbecoming manner.
He has sinned against the king’s wife, having had to do with such and such a wife
of yours. And besides, it is he who has eaten the king’s peacock. Moreover, he has
received in a friendly manner and has supplied with all necessaries men coming from
a foreign land. But you, O father, have always held him dearer than all others, and
no one save him has pleased you.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>In order to sift this matter thoroughly, the king ordered his executioners to put
Mahaushadha to death. Accordingly these men of low caste fastened a karavīra wreath
around his neck, beat a drum, the sound of which resembles the voice of an ass, abused
him with coarse language and threatened him. Like unto the servants of the god of
death, with sharpened weapons in their hands, they led him away to the cemetery. But
no man believed that he would be put to death. The townspeople and villagers had their
eyes full of tears, and they uttered cries of sorrow and despair, and prayed to the
gods, just as if a child of their own were going to be killed; and the poor Kshatriyas
whom Mahaushadha had received kindly and provided with means of subsistence said to
the king’s men, “As we will put this man to death, do ye turn back.”
</p>
<p>As he passed out of the city, the Brahman’s wife Ātmavīrā laid hold of the skirt of
his robe and said, “You who were to have given me the measure of barley, give it and
go,” But Mahaushadha uttered this śloka: “A king does not become a friend, a hangman
has no acquaintances; to women ought no secret to be intrusted; peacock’s flesh ought
no one to eat; to the Brahman’s wife Ātmavīrā a man ought not to admit that he possesses
a measure of barley.”
</p>
<p>As he walked along uttering these words, the executioners said, “Have you, who are
endowed with knowledge and excellent wisdom, anything to set forth?”
</p>
<p>Mahaushadha replied, “O king, I have nothing to set forth; but in the despair of anguish
I said what was needful.”
</p>
<p>“What is that?”
</p>
<p>He replied, “A king does not become a friend,” and so forth. And he continued, “O
king, I beseech you to listen to me a little. When I said, ‘A king does not become
a friend,’ could you not perceive that I <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>said so with reference to earlier times, when you had absolutely no influence over
villages, towns, and cities?”
</p>
<p>When they had gone somewhat farther, it was suggested to King Janaka that he should
again ask Mahaushadha what he had to set forth. Then the king called to him and questioned
him. He replied, “O king, from being one who had merely food, drink, and service,
you have by my means become a king ruling the earth, with a realm, an army, and treasures.
But you, without recognising what I did for you in early days, are sending me to death,
on which account I uttered the words, ‘A king does not become a friend.’ I said also,
‘A hangman has no acquaintances.’ This hangman, if he were to go without bed and clothing
to the king in order to obtain the means of living from the king, when he had drawn
nigh unto the king, would not be received by him; but I have bestowed land on the
hungry fugitive, by means of which he has by this time become prosperous. Now he conducts
me to my death, on which account I said, ‘A hangman has no acquaintances.’ As regards
the words, ‘To women ought no secret to be intrusted,’ I uttered them for the following
reason. When you, O king, sitting one day in the midst of your court, asked whom one
might venture to trust, and the ministers replied one’s father, or mother, or sister,
or comrades, but you, O king, said that a man should intrust a secret to his wife,
because a man’s wife is the half of his body, then did I entertain the idea of bringing
the whole matter before the eyes of the king. In order to provide a test, I hid away
the king’s peacock, and took another peacock, which I ate. Then I took from the chamber
of the women the ornaments belonging to a certain woman, and hung them around the
neck of a certain courtesan, and led her into my house. Be pleased, O king, to look
upon that courtesan.”
</p>
<p>When the king had placed side by side the courtesan <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>and the designated inmate of his women’s chamber, and had looked upon them both, and
had found that there was a remarkable similarity in their appearance, figure, behaviour,
and characteristics, so that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other,
then the king, after some consideration, perceived that Mahaushadha was innocent.
</p>
<p>“As to the words [continued Mahaushadha], ‘To the Brahman’s wife Ātmavīrā a man ought
not to admit that he possesses a measure of barley,’ I uttered them for this reason.
When you had sentenced me to death, and the executioners were leading me away, she
called out, ‘Give me the measure of barley,’ and on its account seized me by the skirt
of my robe.”
</p>
<p>When all this was made clear to the eyes of the king, he rejoiced, and gave orders
that Mahaushadha should be released, and he heaped upon him tokens of honour. Mahaushadha
made obeisance to the king, and then said, “O king, have you learnt what the secrecy
of wives is? I have no longer any need of your daughter. I will seek me a wife like
unto myself in race, beauty, character, and wisdom.”
</p>
<p>When the king had granted him permission, he went to the mountain forest Kaksha,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3265src" href="#xd31e3265">8</a> in order to find for himself a maiden. He had put on the dress of a Brahman, and
carried a water-jug in his right hand, his body being adorned with the string of sacrifice
and covered with the skin of a gazelle, and his face marked with three lines of ointment.
When he had gone half-way, darkness came on. A Brahman asked him whence he came.
</p>
<p>“From the Videha land,” he replied.
</p>
<p>“Whither do you intend to go?”
</p>
<p>“To the Kaksha forest.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Do you know any one in whose house you can find shelter?”
</p>
<p>Mahaushadha said that he did not. Then the Brahman took him into his own house and
entertained him in a becoming manner. But Mahaushadha suspected that his host’s wife,
who loved another man, was a worthless woman. When he took his departure next day
the Brahman said to him, “Consider this house as your own when you come here on your
journeyings to and fro.”
</p>
<p>“That will I do,” replied Mahaushadha, and went his way.
</p>
<p>About half-way there was a barley-field, and in it he saw a very beautiful maiden,
of high race and of great modesty.
</p>
<p>As soon as he saw her a longing after her entered into his mind.
</p>
<p>“Good maiden,” he asked, “who are you? Whose daughter are you? What is your name?”
</p>
<p>“I am Viśākhā,” she replied.
</p>
<p>“Whose daughter are you?”
</p>
<p>“His who works in wood for all the village.”
</p>
<p>Then thought Mahaushadha, “Her form is fair, but I will now test her intelligence
a little.”
</p>
<p>He went into a wheat-field, lifted up his hands, and while he flourished his hands
on high, he trampled on the wheat with his feet. Then said Viśākhā, “O Pundit, as
you have flourished your hands on high, so also ought you to flourish on high your
feet.”
</p>
<p>“This maiden is clever,” he thought. Then he said with a smile, “You are very brilliant,
O maiden, seeing that you have earrings and armlets.”
</p>
<p>“The reason is, O Pundit, that both have little oxen,” said Viśākhā.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3290src" href="#xd31e3290">9</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then said Mahaushadha, “The maiden is of fair form and charming appearance.”
</p>
<p>“That is through the favour of the village elder,” replied Viśākhā.
</p>
<p>“Where has your father gone?” he asked after a time.
</p>
<p>“He has gone to make two roads out of one. After collecting the twigs of the thorn-bushes,
he uses them for making the road. In this manner he gives men two roads.”
</p>
<p>“Where has your mother gone?”
</p>
<p>“To fetch seeds from the fruits of the field.”
</p>
<p>“Maiden, shall I take you to be my wife?”
</p>
<p>“If the head of the village gives permission,” said the maiden.
</p>
<p>“Show me the way,” he said, “by which one can go straight and safely to the Kaksha
forest.”
</p>
<p>She pointed out to him a crooked road, and then set out herself along another road.
There she took off her clothes beside a tank, shut one eye, and while waiting to see
if he would recognise her or not, bowed down upon one side and said, “In the direction
of the hand which is used in eating should one go. From the direction of the hand
which is not used in eating should one deviate, and so go to the Rice-Soup forest.”
</p>
<p>When Mahaushadha had gone some way along the road indicated to him, he perceived her
from afar off, and said, “Fair one with the roguish eyes, having on no garment woven
of cotton, but being clothed with the unspun and unweaved, show me how it is possible
to go to Kusumagrāma.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon said the maiden, slightly smiling, “Here leave on one side the left-hand
road, where there is corn and the palāsa blossoms display themselves; there, O Brahman,
must you take your way.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3308src" href="#xd31e3308">10</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>He set forth. Coming to the house of Viśākhā’s father, he found that her parents were
not at home. So he said to the village head-men, “If you allow it, I will take this
woman to be my wife.”
</p>
<p>When the head-men of the village heard these words, they immediately with one accord
began to upbraid him, saying, “You wretched mendicant Brahman, are not you ashamed
to want such a maiden as our Viśākhā? Get away with you at once from this spot. Or
must we hand you over to be devoured by fierce dogs?”
</p>
<p>Driven away by them, he returned to Viśākhā. While he was still at a distance, she
bade him welcome. When he told her of his interview with the village head-men, who
had been on the point of beating him, she said, “How and in what manner did you speak?”
</p>
<p>When he had told her everything, Viśākhā said to him, “O Brahman, you are not expert
in such matters. Have you behaved in the way in which a man ought to propose for a
maiden?”
</p>
<p>“How else, then, ought one to act?” asked the Brahman.
</p>
<p>“First of all,” replied the maiden, “the man must draw near. Then he must gain favour.
And if that is granted, he must offer hospitality and organise an entertainment, after
which he may bring forward his desire.”
</p>
<p>He went away and acted in accordance with this advice, entertaining the village head-men
at an excellent banquet. Then he arose and asked for Viśākhā. This time they gave
their assent. Just as this point was reached her parents arrived. Then Mahaushadha
and the village head-men asked her parents for her. The parents were of opinion that
the matter required consideration.
</p>
<p>Then said the village head-men, “What is there to consider about? He is a young, shapely,
handsome, <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>learned Brahman, perfectly versed in the Vedas and Vedāngas. So give him your daughter
without further consideration.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Mahaushadha offered hospitality to the Brahmans, and he received the maiden
as his wife. The next day he invited his wife’s parents, paid them honour, bestowed
upon them raiment and gifts in return for the bride, and then went his way to King
Janaka in Videha.
</p>
<p>On the way a Brahman entertained him at the festival of the fourteenth day of the
half-moon, and gave him as a present a measure of barley, which he poured into a corner
of his robe. When he came to the house of his friend he knocked at the door. The Brahman’s
wife said, “Who is there?” He replied, “It is I, your husband’s friend.” She replied,
“My husband is not at home, and as there is no one else here, I cannot admit any man
during his absence. Seek for shelter elsewhere.”
</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, while Mahaushadha was considering how it was that she did not admit
him, he saw another man admitted. Then said Mahaushadha, “There was a reason for my
not being admitted.”
</p>
<p>While he was still thinking the matter over, the Brahman himself came up from a village
and called aloud at the door. When his wife heard her husband’s voice, she considered
what she should do, and with some misgivings hid her visitor away in a basket.
</p>
<p>After this the two men who were outside entered in and sat down. Then said Mahaushadha
to the Brahman’s wife, “Where shall I put this barley?”
</p>
<p>“On the floor,” she replied.
</p>
<p>The Brahman said, “Mice might come and eat it.”
</p>
<p>He looked under the bed and searched all the ends and corners of the house, but nothing
came to light. All at once he saw a basket laid aside, into which he thought the corn
might be put.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Into this basket will I pour the barley,” said Mahaushadha.
</p>
<p>“That basket contains a treasure of mine,” said the Brahman’s wife. “How can barley
be put into it?”
</p>
<p>“Set aside the treasure in some pot,” said the husband, “then we can pour the barley
in here.”
</p>
<p>Mahaushadha also said, “In order that the mice may not render the barley useless,
it must be poured in here.”
</p>
<p>Then said the Brahman’s wife, who became terrified at the thought of the consequences,
“The basket is damp; the barley will get spoilt inside it.”
</p>
<p>“You need not be uneasy,” replied Mahaushadha to the Brahman’s wife. “I will take
care that no dampness remains in it, and that the barley is not spoilt.”
</p>
<p>Then he stood up, reversed his gazelle skin, and tied the string of sacrifice twice
round his neck. Then he went out to fetch wood and water, with the intention of cleansing
the basket.
</p>
<p>The Brahman’s wife, experiencing the pain of parting from her lover, and fearing that
he would be killed, sent a messenger with all speed to his house, in order that, things
being so, some one might come from thence immediately. As soon as his father heard
the news, he came to Mahaushadha and said, “I want to purchase this basket.”
</p>
<p>“Be of good cheer and take it,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>“On what terms?”
</p>
<p>“On payment of five hundred gold pieces, not otherwise.”
</p>
<p>While thus speaking, Mahaushadha lighted a lamp close by the basket. But the father,
thinking that it would not be well to let the matter become known, opened the door
of the house, and had the basket taken up by a strong man and conveyed to his own
house.
</p>
<p>On the following day Mahaushadha gave a hundred gold pieces to the man to whom the
house belonged, told him what his wife’s character was like, and advised <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>him, after such an occurrence as this, to be on his guard. The remaining four hundred
pieces he made over to that Brahman, in order that he might go with them to the Kaksha
forest, and present them to Viśākhā, the maiden whom he had asked in marriage.
</p>
<p>“Tell them [he said] that I am no Brahman, but Mahaushadha, the chief minister of
the king of Videha, and that I came in that guise only to carry out my quest. Therefore
must they watch carefully over the maiden.”
</p>
<p>Having in this way sent the gold pieces and a missive along with them, he himself
went to King Janaka.
</p>
<p>The Brahman went to the Kaksha forest, and delivered to Viśākhā the missive and three
hundred of the pieces of gold. When Viśākhā perceived that she had not received the
fourth hundred, she at once began looking under the bed.
</p>
<p>“What are you looking for there?” he asked.
</p>
<p>“Men have come from the court of the king,” she replied, “with orders to seize the
malefactor, and have gone away. Therefore do I look for him who has not gone.”
</p>
<p>Then she took some clay and said to that Brahman, “As I do not know who it is who
has thus come here, I should like to try if a foot can go in here or not. So put your
foot in here for a while.”
</p>
<p>When the Brahman, to avoid being suspected, had inserted his foot into the clay, she
suddenly drove a peg<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3360src" href="#xd31e3360">11</a> into it.
</p>
<p>“Why do you arrest me?” asked the Brahman.
</p>
<p>“Because that man sent me four hundred pieces, but you have abstracted a hundred of
them,” she replied.
</p>
<p>The Brahman was astounded, and thought: “This <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>woman and Mahaushadha are two demons. Two great demons have combined together.” And
he paid her the residue. Then her parents came in, and he said, showing them the gold,
“The man is no Brahman. He is the king of Videha’s principal minister, Mahaushadha.”
</p>
<p>When the maiden’s parents and kinsmen heard that, they said that they were allied
with a man of power, that they were in that respect very fortunate, and that their
family would be made famous by means of Mahaushadha.
</p>
<p>When Mahaushadha arrived in the city, and the king heard of that, he and the old ministers
were greatly pleased.
</p>
<p>“How have you fared?” asked the king.
</p>
<p>“I have chosen me a wife,” he replied.
</p>
<p>“What kind of wife?”
</p>
<p>“A very beautiful one,” replied Mahaushadha, “of perfect intelligence, suitable for
me.”
</p>
<p>And he asked the king if, as she was of such a nature, he might now marry her.
</p>
<p>“Except me,” said the king, “is there any man equal to you? And why? Because you are
my chief minister. Therefore marry her to my great pleasure.”
</p>
<p>“O king, I will do so.”
</p>
<p>Surrounded by the band of ministers, Mahaushadha invited the Brahmans, householders,
and populace to be his guests. Collecting together the rest in great numbers, the
elephant-drivers, the horse-drivers, the chariot-drivers, and the goers on foot, he
went to the house of his father-in-law in the mountain forest Kaksha. Having arrived
there, he celebrated a great wedding-feast, and after a time he returned to the city
with his wife, and lived with her there in love’s delights.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After this there came from the north to King Janaka in Videha five hundred merchants
with goods and horses. <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>In that city lived many courtesans, who were wont, by means of their wiles, to despoil
of their goods the merchants who came thither. As soon as they heard that merchants
had come from the north, they fastened upon them. But the chief of the merchants was
very cautious. The most attractive of the women took him in hand, but with no success.
Then she called the merchants together, and requested them to render their chief well
disposed towards her. But although the merchants and the women took great pains day
after day, yet he did not yield to enticement. Then that courtesan went to the chief
and joked and laughed.
</p>
<p>“Why do you trouble yourself?” said the chief. “You will not entice me.”
</p>
<p>“What will you give me,” she asked, “if I do entice you?”
</p>
<p>“I will give you five of our best horses. But if you fail to entice me, and you have
no money, then you must follow after me.”
</p>
<p>Thus ran their talk. But in spite of all her efforts she could not attain her end.
</p>
<p>One day the merchants said to their chief, “Do as other people do?”
</p>
<p>“I have enjoyed the woman by night in a dream,” replied the chief.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3398src" href="#xd31e3398">12</a>
</p>
<p>The merchants repeated this to the woman, who called upon the king’s men to arrest
the merchant, saying, “As you have enjoyed my love, pay me five first-rate horses.”
</p>
<p>“You lie, disreputable female,” replied the merchant.
</p>
<p>So they two carried up their dispute to the palace.
</p>
<p>The king and his court attempted to settle the question. Evening came, but still they
did not succeed. Worn and fretted by hunger, they resolved to postpone the decision
of the question, and went to their homes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Mahaushadha came home that evening, Viśākhā said, “My lord, why have you tarried
so long to-day?”
</p>
<p>He gave her a full account of the whole question which they had not been able to settle.
</p>
<p>“If a question remains unsettled by all of you,” she said, “after being thus considered
and discussed, how comes it that you hold such a position?”
</p>
<p>“Such being the state of affairs,” said Mahaushadha, “can you, perchance, decide the
question?”
</p>
<p>“I can,” she replied. “See how great is my judgment! Go and order the five good horses
to be placed at the edge of a piece of water. Then let the king and the ministers
meet together at that place and give their opinions on the matter. If it turns out
that, as the woman says, the merchant has really enjoyed her, then let the five good
horses be given to her. But if it be proved that he did so only in a dream, then let
her be shown the image of the horses in the water. If she says that she can neither
grasp nor use them, then let her be told that, just as it is impossible to grasp that
image, so is it also with the fruition of love in a dream.”
</p>
<p>All this was carried out. All were astonished at this decision, and the king asked
who had been the discoverer of this way of escape. Whereupon Mahaushadha replied that
Viśākhā had discovered it. Then all perceived that the carpenter’s daughter was exceedingly
clever, and her fame spread abroad throughout all lands.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After that a merchant from the north made a present of two mares<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3422src" href="#xd31e3422">13</a> to the king, and said, “These two mares, O king, are dam and foal, but which the
dam is and which the foal, nobody knows.” When in this case also the king and his
court were in difficulties, the carpenter’s daughter Viśākhā settled the question
as before, saying <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>that the thick-haired mare was the dam and the soft-haired the foal.
</p>
<p>Another time a snake-catcher brought two serpents, one of which was male and the other
female, but nobody knew which was which. When Mahaushadha consulted <span class="corr" id="xd31e3429" title="Source: Viśākha">Viśākhā</span>, she laughed, and wondered how it was that the king’s ministers were unable to solve
such a problem. What was needed was to fasten the leaf of a cotton plant to the end
of a reed, and to stroke the backs of the serpents with the cotton. The serpent which
was unable to endure that stroking would be the male.
</p>
<p>On another occasion, a merchant from the south brought a stem of sandal-wood,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3434src" href="#xd31e3434">14</a> of which no one knew the upper end from the lower. Mahaushadha again consulted his
wife, who told him to throw the stem into a pool. The root end would then sink downwards.
</p>
<p>Once King Janaka was pleased to try which of his ministers was capable of recognising
precious stones. With this intent he caused a gem to be fastened to the top of a standard
upon the belvedere, underneath which was a tank. The king promised to give the gem
to him who should recognise it; but no one who went into the water, intending to grasp
at the light he saw there, was considered entitled to obtain it. When Viśākhā was
consulted by her husband, she said that he must look upwards, for that light was only
the reflection of the gem attached to the standard, and that it was necessary to go
in the direction of the standard in order to obtain the gem.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>As Viśākhā was very handsome, the six ministers tried, by means of all sorts of presents
of gold, silver, and precious stones, to entice her into making an assignation, but
they could not succeed in doing so. As they did not desist, she asked her husband
if it was really the <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>custom of the country that every young and handsome woman should be cajoled by other
men. He replied that this took place everywhere, for men were greedy after all women,
and they were instructed by the women themselves; but that if a woman was prudent,
she did not give her consent. Then said Viśākhā, “If I were to bring a man of that
kind to harm or disgrace, would any danger arise out of it?” Mahaushadha said, “Do
so, and fear not.” So she told him that he was to feign an illness, and she would
turn it to good account. He did so. Then she sent messengers to inform the ministers,
who had become acquainted with his indisposition, that she would grant them the fulfilment
of their desires. Having caused an image of Mahaushadha to be made of wood, she dressed
it and laid it in his bed. To each of the ministers she sent word to come to her at
a certain hour, without letting the others know anything about it. She had also caused
six chests to be made, and had distributed them in six of her rooms. Each of the ministers,
on his arrival, she hid away in one of the chests. Next day she let the report spread
abroad that Mahaushadha was dead. Thereupon the king and his court, as well as the
rest of the people, broke forth into lamentation. But Viśākhā locked the chests and
took them to the king, and said, “Now that Mahaushadha is dead, here are his treasures
of gold, silver, and precious stones, sealed with his own signet.” While the king
was grieving that these presents should have been made to him on the very day of their
owner’s death, Mahaushadha came into the palace by another way, laughing and adorned
with flowers. Having made obeisance to the king, he said, “Do you mean now to take
possession of my property, O king, although you have never shadowed me with the canopy
of your grace?”
</p>
<p>“I have not taken it,” said the king. “It was brought here from your own house.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Great king and Mahaushadha,” said Viśākhā, “there is another world besides this.
These are precious stones from it. Take them as a pledge. Great king, these are the
men who have dishonoured me, the widow separated from her husband, and have stolen
from me my treasure.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Mahaushadha pointed out the excellent intentions in the minds of the first
ministers. When the king had looked in, and had seen the six ministers with their
hair and beards shorn, and their hands and feet drawn together, he laughed and said
to Mahaushadha, “Tell me, whose contrivance is this?”
</p>
<p>“It is Viśākhā’s contrivance,” he replied, and then he proceeded to tell the whole
story. The king marvelled at the acuteness and resolution shown by Viśākhā, and the
cleverness of the carpenter’s daughter Viśākhā obtained praise in all lands.
</p>
<p>The king resolved that Mahaushadha should try to find him a wife of similar discretion,
in which case everything would be placed on a good footing both at home and as regards
affairs exterior to the palace.
</p>
<p>“Where shall I look for her?” asked Mahaushadha.
</p>
<p>“The king of Panchāla has an exceedingly beautiful daughter called Aushadhī,” replied
King Janaka. “She is endowed with knowledge and memory, and I have heard that in acuteness
she resembles Viśākhā. Obtain her for me as my wife.”
</p>
<p>“O king,” said Mahaushadha, “in this matter must some stratagem be employed, for there
is enmity between you and him.”
</p>
<p>Then King Janaka sent his ministers and his Purohita in order to make proposals of
marriage. The king of Panchāla called his ministers together and asked them what he
should do. They said, “As King Janaka formerly refused to listen to your orders, we
must manage so that they may fall into our power. Tell them that you will give your
daughter, and that an appointment <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>must be made for the purpose of receiving her, at a certain hour, on such and such
a day of the half-moon, at such and such a place.”
</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, they went forth and announced that King Janaka was to receive
the Princess Aushadhī.
</p>
<p>“When and where?” asked the envoys.
</p>
<p>“On such and such a day, at an appointed hour,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>Thereupon the king of Panchāla sent forth invitations to the wedding. And he prepared
food and drink, and infused into it divers kinds of poisons. When all was ready, he
sent out messengers to the people to come forthwith.
</p>
<p>When Mahaushadha heard that, he said to King Janaka, “It is not fitting that we should
act hastily.”
</p>
<p>“For what reason?”
</p>
<p>“This king is a neighbour who has always been opposed to us, at variance with us.
We must send a spy in advance.”
</p>
<p>“Whom shall we send?” said the king.
</p>
<p>“O king,” said Mahaushadha, “be at ease. I have a parrot called Charaka,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3471src" href="#xd31e3471">15</a> who is clever and honest. Him will I send. He will return after he has held converse
with all.”
</p>
<p>“Do so,” said the king.
</p>
<p>The parrot flew off, and considered to whom he should draw nigh, with whom he should
make friends and hold converse. In spite of looking around on all sides, he could
detect nothing, and he had to consider how he should begin the usual style of business.
Entering the palace, and there looking about him, he saw a maina<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3477src" href="#xd31e3477">16</a> sitting on some timber-work, and flew up to her, and the two birds took pleasure
in each other’s company.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>She asked him where he came from. He replied, “I come from King Śibi in the north.
I was the guardian of a park, and I had as wife an excellent, beautiful, clever, devoted,
and sweet-spoken maina. Having flown to a distance one day, she was carried off by
a falcon. Full of grief and trouble on this account, I have gone wandering hither
and thither, and so have come to where you are. Will not you, O good one, be my wife?”
</p>
<p>“Never has it been heard or seen,” she replied, “that a maina became the wife of a
parrot. I have heard that really the wife of a parrot is a parrot too.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the parrot tried by other flights in this and that direction to draw nigh
unto her, and to render her well disposed towards him, whereby he entered into loving
relations with her.
</p>
<p>When the parrot saw in the king’s palace many kinds of food, such as honey-puffs and
other dainties, being cooked in pans, and many cates made of sugar, he said to the
maina, “Wherefore are these things being cooked? Is it likely that we shall get any?”
Then he said to the maina in verse, “Of this plentiful fresh oil which is being cooked
in the pan, shall we partake? Answer softly, O maina.”
</p>
<p>“That which is being cooked in the pan,” replied the maina, “shall not be your food,
O clever parrot Charaka. With this food is poison mixed for the benefit of Janaka.”
</p>
<p>Then the parrot, employing wisdom, artfully said to the maina, “As it is said that
the king of Panchāla is about to give his daughter to Janaka, and the news of this
has been spread abroad in all the land, I ask whose words are truthful? on whose words
can reliance be placed?”
</p>
<p>“Clever parrot Charaka,” said the maina, “this evil one is not going to give him his
daughter. The men of evil purpose seek only to slay him.”
</p>
<p>When the parrot Charaka had heard this, having seen and heard, sought and learnt,
he returned home, like a <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>merchant who has succeeded in obtaining gains. But to the maina he said, referring
to King Śibi, “Now must I go, O good one, in order to let King Śibi know that I have
found a soft-spoken maina like unto my wife.”
</p>
<p>“O lord,” said the maina, “when you have gone away, and have informed King <span class="corr" id="xd31e3503" title="Source: Sibi">Śibi</span>, let it be made known after a space of seven days, after no longer lapse of time.
Let King Śibi know what are my descent, my family, and my means. For my sake be not
lost.”
</p>
<p>The parrot flew away, and gave a full account of all these things to Mahaushadha,
who made King Janaka acquainted therewith.
</p>
<p>When the king of Panchāla saw that Janaka was not coming, he equipped a complete army,
and went forth against King Janaka, and besieged his capital. The first minister,
Mahaushadha, perceived that there was no withstanding him in fight, so he considered
how he could excite discord. By means of sending divers presents to King Śibi’s five
hundred ministers he produced dissension. When this had been brought about, Janaka
sent envoys to the king of Panchāla with a message to the effect that, although he
was in a position to fight the king of Panchāla, yet he wished to be reconciled with
him, and not to fight with him who was his father-in-law. The king of Panchāla should
know that in King Janaka’s hands lay life and death. But though he could fight with
him, yet he would rather not do so. If the king of Panchāla was in doubt, let him
consider that Janaka had sent such and such presents to such and such ministers.
</p>
<p>The king of Panchāla laid hands on those ministers with the presents, and that same
evening he returned home. On his arrival there, he ordered the five hundred ministers
to be executed, and made their sons ministers in their stead, and he became reconciled
with King Janaka.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Mahaushadha learnt that the ministers had been put to death, he rejoiced at having
brought this about. They being dead, he said to the king, “Now will I go myself to
see if I can obtain the princess or not.”
</p>
<p>When he had arrived in the land of Panchāla, the king invited him to enter the city.
But he replied that he would stay where he was in the park, or in case he entered
the city, he would go to the house of a certain minister. The king of Panchāla was
alarmed at these words, thinking that Mahaushadha might be wishing again to sow discord
between him and his ministers, so he sent to tell him that he might stay where he
was if he wished it.
</p>
<p>Now the ministers reflected that Mahaushadha had deprived their fathers of life, and
they thought, remembering the old grudge, that if they brought the matter energetically
before the king, Mahaushadha would never return home. So, after they had met together,
they said to the king, “It is Mahaushadha in whom King Janaka has such a source of
mental power. When he is at home by the king’s side, no one can injure the king, but
while he is here, we might well go forth again to attack King Janaka.”
</p>
<p>The king consented thereto, and they set out for King Janaka’s capital with a fully
equipped army. King Janaka also made himself ready. Now Mahaushadha learnt that the
king of Panchāla had invaded King Janaka’s country by such and such a road. After
remaining a little longer where he was, he learnt that the treasures of the king of
Panchāla were kept in a certain place, and that the king’s daughter, Aushadhī by name,
lived there also. So he went thither with a small troop of trusty adherents and surrounded
the treasury. Entering therein, he emptied it of its contents and carried off the
princess along with the gold and precious things. Then he got his army ready, and
entered King Janaka’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>country from a different side. Thereat King Janaka rejoiced, and so did the ministers,
the villagers, and the rest of the people, saying that he had accomplished a great
work, and they made him many demonstrations of honour.
</p>
<p>When the king of Panchāla’s ministers heard that Mahaushadha had arrived with the
maiden and the treasure, they abandoned the siege of the capital and returned to their
own country; and King Janaka, having obtained the maiden as his wife, lived with her
in happiness and love.
</p>
<p>After a while, the king of Panchāla sent a messenger to his daughter, and asked for
information as to who it was by whose coming the matter had been found out, and who
it was who had brought about the dissensions. She sent word back that it was Mahaushadha’s
parrot named Charaka, which, being endowed with human speech, had spied the matter
out. Then the king of Panchāla desired that it should at any rate be delivered up
to him. So with great difficulty she contrived to catch it in a net, and she sent
it to her father. The king flew into a passion, upbraided the bird in divers ways,
and then ordered it to be killed. The parrot Charaka fell at the king’s feet, and
besought him to allow it to die as its father and grandfather had died. The king gave
his consent, and asked in what manner its father and grandfather had been put to death.
When its tail had been wrapped in cotton and drenched with mustard-oil, and when all
this had been set on fire, and the bird was let go to fly up into the air, it set
the whole of the royal palace in a blaze,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3522src" href="#xd31e3522">17</a> and then dived under water. When it had returned home, and King Janaka and Mahaushadha
asked <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>it whence it came, it gave them a full account of everything which had taken place,
whereat they rejoiced. But the king of Panchāla, being full of wrath, sent a letter
to say that as the parrot had after such a fashion brought about injury, it must be
again sent to him without fail. His daughter laid hands on the bird and sent it. The
king of Panchāla in his rage plucked it quite bare, made a mere lump of flesh of it,
and with the words, “Go and get eaten,” flung it out of the window. Thereupon a falcon
snapped it up. But it besought the falcon, saying, “If you eat me, you will have food
for one day only; but if you will let me go, I will take care that you shall receive
every day much food and whatever else you need.”
</p>
<p>The falcon gave heed to its words, and after the parrot had confirmed them by an oath,
it was released. Charaka said, “At such and such a spot is the king’s temple, convey
me thither.” The falcon did so. The parrot went inside and crept into a hole.
</p>
<p>Next day the Brahmans came to offer sacrifices to the deity. As they were preparing
to offer perfumes, incense, food, gifts, and oblations, Charaka cried out, “O Brahmans,
to the sinful king of Panchāla shall ye convey these words of mine: ‘As you have committed
such and such a sin, I have inflicted injury upon you. If you do not act in obedience
to my words, I will do the same again. You must bring day by day as an offering of
food a whole measure full of red raw meat, sesamum, and rice porridge. After that
I will consider what is to be done.’ ”
</p>
<p>The Brahman went to the king and told him this. Thereupon the king ordered food-offerings
and oblations to be prepared, and came every day with the ministers and the Purohita
in order to beseech the deity to say if he were forgiven or not, and to promise that
he would act in accordance with the divine commands.
</p>
<p>When, after some time, the wings of the parrot Charaka <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>had grown again, it became capable of flying, and felt a desire to take to flight.
Then it said, “You, O king, together with the commander of the army, the queen, the
prince, and the ministers, must appear before me with heads shorn as smooth as pestles.
If ye do so, then will I vouchsafe forgiveness.”
</p>
<p>The king took this to heart and behaved accordingly, and the whole party, with heads
shorn like pestles, proceeded to the abode of the deity, fell at its feet and begged
for pardon. Then the parrot flew aloft, uttering this verse:—
</p>
<p>“The doer of the deed is requited. See how the plucker in his turn is plucked! Now
he who by himself was plucked has thoroughly well plucked the enemy and all the rest.”
</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, Charaka flew away to Mahaushadha, who asked it whence it came,
as he had not seen it for so long a time. It gave a full account of what kind of trick
it had played. Mahaushadha was delighted therewith, and he reported it to King Janaka,
who likewise rejoiced greatly, and considered himself fortunate in having so intelligent
a minister.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>At another time the king, in order to see which of his ministers was the cleverest,
took it into his head to summon them, and to give to each of them a dog, with directions
to train it to speak with a human voice within a given time. The ministers took the
dogs home with them, and managed to rear them properly, but not to teach them to speak.
</p>
<p>Mahaushadha took his dog home, and gave it a place at a little distance from the table,
fastening it to a peg. The dog was accustomed to see various kinds of meats, drinks,
and soups prepared for Mahaushadha, but could not get at them. By means of giving
it little food and that bad, Mahaushadha brought it about that the <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>dog was neither dead nor alive, and was lean and gaunt with exhaustion.
</p>
<p>After a time the king ordered the dogs to be brought, whether instructed or not instructed.
The other ministers, who were not versed in the sciences, had not been able to teach
their dogs to speak. Then the king ordered Mahaushadha to bring the dog which had
been handed over to him. When the gaunt, famished dog appeared before the king, he
asked why it was so thin. Mahaushadha replied, “O king, I have given it the same kind
of food that I ate myself.” But the dog exclaimed, “O king, that is not true. I am
all but dead with hunger.” Thereupon Mahaushadha said, “After this fashion have I
taught the dog to speak.” Whereat the king was highly pleased.
</p>
<p>Another time, when the king wished to make a similar trial, he ordered each of the
ministers to feed and water a sheep in such a manner that the sheep should become
strong without waxing fat.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3555src" href="#xd31e3555">18</a> Five hundred of the ministers were unaware how to set about this matter. They reared
their sheep, but the sheep became fat. But Mahaushadha, while he placed delicate food
before his sheep, set up in front of it a wooden wolf which he had provided for the
purpose. The sight of the wolf frightened the sheep so much that it grew up strong
without becoming fat. When the king saw that the sheep of the other ministers were
flourishing and very fat, but that Mahaushadha’s sheep had become strong without growing
fat, he highly commended his wisdom.
</p>
<p>On another occasion the king was again desirous of finding out who was possessed of
wisdom. The five hundred sons of the ministers were holding a feast in the park. As
they sat there eating and drinking, they took to describing marvellous things, each
one being called upon to state whatever wondrous thing he had <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>either himself experienced or had heard described while tarrying at home. Then out
of friendship they told one another the marvels they had witnessed at home and elsewhere.
Along with the rest Mahaushadha’s son was called upon by the young men to relate something.
He said that there was a stone in his father’s house which, although it formed the
base of a column, would yet, if thrown into water, swim to and fro, and lend itself
to rubbing and kneading, and so forth. The youths expressed their opinion that no
such marvel existed in any of their houses. As he would not give way, and they doubted
his word, he said that he would stake upon it five hundred pieces of gold. He told
this to his father, who said, “Son, do not show them the stone.” So when the youths
came, he did not show them the stone, and his five hundred gold pieces were forfeited.
</p>
<p>After a time Mahaushadha took some monkeys and gave them a musical training. Then
he said to his son, “Go to your comrades and tell them, in reference to your former
undertaking about marvels seen at home, that you are willing to stake twice as much
money as before on the fact that you can show in your house musical monkeys, capable
of dancing and singing and playing on the drum.” In accordance with these instructions
the young man, after speaking of other things, passed on to that subject, and said
that he had seen such creatures. They declared that they had never either seen or
heard of monkeys which performed musically. “What will you give me if I show you some?”
he said. They replied, “You have already lost five hundred pieces of gold, and now
you will lose a thousand if you cannot show us these monkeys, but have been talking
nonsense as before. But if you do show them to us, then we will pay you that sum.”
When they had settled this wager, the monkeys were brought into the royal palace,
where they played and sang and danced before the king. So the <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>young men were obliged to pay the thousand pieces of gold. The king was greatly astonished;
he had never seen or heard of anything like it before. Thereupon the king, the ministers,
and the inhabitants of the city all paid great honour to Mahaushadha, in that he was
wise and clever above all other men.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>It happened that there was born unto a very learned Brahman in the land of Videha
a very beautiful daughter, whom he determined he would give in marriage to him only
who equalled himself in acuteness and knowledge. She received the name of Udumbarikā.
</p>
<p>Unto another Brahman there was born a bad-looking son, unlike his father, and marked
with eighteen signs of ugliness. On account of his ugliness his parents, at the time
of his birth, gave him the name of Virūpa. As he was so hideous, and his parents were
ashamed of his ugliness, they thought it would be of no use to have so bad-looking
a creature educated. But when he had grown up, being desirous of instruction, he determined
to go to another country in order to study. There he was accepted as a pupil by a
Brahman, and he soon made himself master of all the knowledge his teacher possessed.
</p>
<p>In consequence of this, Udumbarikā’s father determined, in spite of Virūpa’s ugliness,
to give him his daughter to wife. However Virūpa did not dare to draw nigh unto her,
but resolved to go back to his own home, in order to live with her there.
</p>
<p>When Udumbarikā set eyes upon this paragon of ugliness, she being herself beautiful,
she felt ashamed of him. Virūpa set out with her for his own country. On the way their
stock of travelling provisions came to an end. Arriving at the edge of a piece of
water, they threw themselves down upon the ground, feeling very hungry. A fellow-traveller,
having stirred up some meal and water with a bit of wood, began to partake of <span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>it, and the woman, tormented by hunger, begged to have some too. Then Virūpa took
a handful of meal and partook of it by himself.
</p>
<p>“As I also am sorely tormented by hunger,” said Udumbarikā, “I would fain partake
of that water.”
</p>
<p>“As the early Rishis and law-teachers have forbidden women to partake of such water,
I will not give you any,” replied Virūpa.
</p>
<p>While they were suffering from hunger in a desert during a time of drought, Virūpa
found some dog’s flesh, which he roasted and ate. When Udumbarikā wanted some too,
he would not give her any, because the Rishis had forbidden women to partake of such
food. Thereupon she gave way to all kinds of wailing, lamenting that she, unhappy
one that she was, should be tormented by the pangs of hunger, and asking wherefore,
on account of what fault of hers, had her parents wedded her to such a man.
</p>
<p>They proceeded farther, and saw a ripe Udumbara tree. Virūpa climbed it and feasted
on its fruit. Udumbarikā said he ought not to eat it all himself, but ought to give
some to her also. He ate the ripe fruit and threw down to her only what was unripe.
She told him he ought not to fling her the unripe fruit only, but ought to give her
the ripe fruit also. He replied, “If you want ripe fruit, climb the tree yourself
and pluck and eat.”
</p>
<p>Tormented by hunger, she climbed up into the tree with difficulty, and there ate some
fruit. But Virūpa thought, “What can such a wretched man as I am do with such a wife—I,
who can scarcely support myself? She will not so much as look at me.”
</p>
<p>Coming down from the tree, he surrounded it with thorns and then went his way.
</p>
<p>Now it happened that just at that time King Janaka went out hunting, and he heard
in the forest the wailing of Udumbarikā deserted by her husband. Following <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>the sound, he caught sight of the bright-eyed one, who seemed to him like a goddess
of the forest. When she had come down from the tree he reposed by her side, and then
set her in his chariot, conveyed her to the city, and gave himself up to pleasure
with her.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Virūpa, as he walked along by himself, repented of having deserted his wife.
So he returned to the Udumbara tree, but found that his wife was not there, and learnt
that King Janaka had taken her away with him, and had made her one of his wives. Thereat
he was sorely grieved.
</p>
<p>He went to the gate of the palace, but he was not admitted within. Then he saw that
there were men at work in the courtyard of the palace, and he resolved to carry stone
along with them. By this means he gained access to the palace, where he saw his wife
and the king in loving converse. He hit upon a plan of speaking with his wife, and
he and she discoursed in verse as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>He.</i> “Golden is the corner-stone. Dost thou rejoice in blaming? Fair one, lovest thou
me not? Take, O carpenter, the stone!”
</p>
<p><i>She.</i> “At that spot did I beseech thee. In my memory dwell the words, ‘To women meat is
forbidden.’ Me didst thou forsake.”
</p>
<p><i>He.</i> “Beside the Udumbara tree, O fair one, hast thou asked me, born beside the river
Ganges. Take, O carpenter, the stone.”
</p>
<p><i>She.</i> “When I asked for meal and water, thus was I answered: ‘It is not right that a woman
should partake thereof.’ Therefore have I hither come.”
</p>
<p><i>He.</i> “Much has the learned mouth spoken. Speak of the countless golden glitter. Fair one,
lovest thou me not? Take, O master, the stone!”
</p>
<p><i>She.</i> “Unripe was what thou didst give me. The ripe didst thou eat thyself. Mindful of
harsh speech do I now sit dallying here.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>He.</i> “Down from the mountain will I dash, poison also will I drink, O Brahman woman. Wailing
for thee am I here. Take, O carpenter, the stone!”
</p>
<p><i>She.</i> “Dash thyself down from the mountain, drink thy poison, O Brahman! In love’s time
thou didst not love. At home must dalliance take place.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>While they two thus held converse, the king became suspicious, and said, “O queen,
as I do not understand what ye are saying to each other, speak to me without fear,
that I may hearken to your words.” As the king was completely under her influence,
she gave him a full account of everything. The king asked her if she wished to go
away with her husband. She did not like to say openly that her husband was repulsive
to her, for she was afraid that he, as he was a Brahman, might bring a curse upon
her by means of evil spells. Then the king asked Mahaushadha what was to be done.
Mahaushadha promised to arrange so that the king would not have to part with her.
</p>
<p>“How so?” asked the king.
</p>
<p>“As this Brahman,” replied Mahaushadha, “is a man of very small means, but these women
are exceedingly grand, I will speak to him after such and such a fashion. If I suggest
it to him, he will look for his wife among your women, without identifying her.”
</p>
<p>The Brahman was summoned, and was asked what he was looking for, and why he had entered
the palace. He replied that he was looking for his wife, whom the king had brought
there.
</p>
<p>“Shall you be able to identify your wife?” asked Mahaushadha.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Virūpa.
</p>
<p>“I will bring the five hundred women before you,” said Mahaushadha. “If you pick out
from among them one who does not belong to you, your body shall be cut to pieces with
weapons.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the king ordered all his wives to appear arrayed in all their bravery, and to
make the greatest possible display of ornaments. And the king caused Udumbarikā to
be placed at the head of all the women, looking like the spouse of Indra, and surrounded
as it were by Apsarases, and situated on a highroad, where sacrifices were brought.
Mahaushadha called the Brahman to the front, and told him to take away his wife if
he recognised her. But when Virūpa saw Udumbarikā and the other women adorned with
all their bravery, he stood still like a snake charmed by a spell. Like one unable
to gaze at the light of day looked the Brahman at the women. Then he saw a female
slave, a carrier of water, like unto a Piśāchī [or female demon] in appearance, standing
at the back behind one of the king’s wives, and he seized her by the hand and said,
“This is my wife.”
</p>
<p>“If that be so, then take her away with you,” said Mahaushadha.
</p>
<p>The Brahman took her and said, “The excellent loves the excellent, and the mediocre
the mediocre; to the crooked one is my heart attached. O fair one, I am like unto
a Piśācha, and you too are a Piśāchī. Come unto me, O Piśāchī. As I am like unto a
Piśācha, we will take pleasure together.”
</p>
<p>Therefore King Janaka forgave Mahaushadha all the faults which he had ever committed.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>One day the king went into the park with his wives, and enjoyed himself there together
with them. One of them took off a string of pearls worth a hundred thousand pieces
of money and hung it on a spray of an aśoka tree. While sporting with the king she
forgot about it and left it there. At midnight, after she had gone back to the palace
with the king, she remembered that she had left her necklace in the forest. Meanwhile
<span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>it had been carried off to the top of a tree by a female monkey.
</p>
<p>The king ordered his men to hasten to the forest and bring back the necklace. They
went there, but they did not find it. Now a beggar had gone there in search of the
remnants of the food of which other men had made a meal. As he came forth from the
forest after partaking of such food, the king’s men arrested him. As no one else was
to be seen there, they called on him to render up the necklace. Although he protested
that he had not taken it, had not even seen it, yet he was beaten with fists and stakes,
and then thrown into prison.
</p>
<p>Tormented by hunger, he reflected that, unless he contrived some cunning way of escape,
he would die there of starvation. So he said to the jailer that he had, it was true,
taken the pearl necklace, but that he had given it to such and such a young merchant.
Him also the king’s men summoned, and the two men were set fast connected by wooden
fetters.
</p>
<p>The merchant used to receive from home dainty food. While he was partaking of it the
beggar asked him for some. But the merchant reviled him, saying, “It is all very well
for you to accuse me of theft in order that I may nourish you with my food. I will
give you none of it.” And having thus spoken, he ate it all up.
</p>
<p>After this, when the merchant wished to change his place, and said, “Let us stand
up and move,” the beggar replied, “I will not listen to your words; I shall not get
up.” Then said the merchant, “Henceforward will I behave so that you will be contented.”
Thus with friendly words and with an oath he won over the beggar, and was able to
do as he wished.
</p>
<p>The next day the merchant sent home orders to provide in future food enough for two
persons. Thereat the beggar was highly pleased, and he reflected that in former times
he used to wander about the whole city <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>without being able to find the means of filling his belly, but now food and drink
in plenty were at hand, and it would be well to call in a courtesan. Accordingly,
he accused one of a share in the theft, and the king’s men set her also in the prison.
When the beggar was sitting in company with these two prisoners and enjoying food
and drink, he said, “Good is it if we get free from here after the space of a dozen
years.”
</p>
<p>While they so enjoyed themselves a further desire arose within them. They thought
that in order to have still more pleasure they must call in a lute-player. So the
beggar accused a lute-player also of having taken the string of pearls. Then the king’s
men cast him also into the prison.
</p>
<p>After some time the others besought the beggar to find some means whereby they might
become free, saying that in that case he should want for nothing. He promised to do
so, and bethought himself that no one could be of use except Mahaushadha. So he told
the king’s men that Mahaushadha’s son had likewise taken part in the affair, and they
sent for him also.
</p>
<p>When Mahaushadha heard that his son had been imprisoned, he felt that he must certainly
go to the palace, for if he did not do so his son would fret himself. On arriving
there, he asked the king what offence his son had committed. The king replied that
he had been imprisoned on the testimony of the beggar with respect to the stolen pearl
necklace. When Mahaushadha had become fully acquainted with the contrivance of the
captives, he said to the king, “The theft has not been committed by any of these people.
Let them all go free on my word.” So they were released.
</p>
<p>After this he went out to the park, and came to the spot, to the very tree, where
they had been before. When he looked closely at the tree, he perceived a female monkey
sitting at the top of it. Then he felt <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>sure that this animal had taken the string of pearls, and that it must be enticed
to come down by some artifice. So he asked the king to go there with his wife, and
when there, to hang a necklace round her neck. When that was done, the monkey, as
it sat on the tree-top, hung the pearl necklace round its neck. Then Mahaushadha told
the king’s wife to dance. When she did so, the monkey on the tree-top also began to
dance; but still the string of pearls did not fall from off its neck. In order to
bring that about, Mahaushadha asked the king to make his wife, as she danced, hang
down her head. Then the monkey also began to dance about with its head hanging down,
whereupon the string of pearls fell down from off its neck. Full of joy, the king
embraced Mahaushadha and bestowed much property upon him.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>After a time the six ministers assembled together and held counsel as to what was
to be done, seeing that whereas they had formerly been esteemed, honoured, and exalted
by the king, they had now lost their credit on account of a half-starved, gross-witted
upstart. Then some of them said, “Inasmuch as we have hitherto been at variance one
with another, therefore have we become destitute of power. Now let us go into the
park, and when we have gone there, let us take an oath and bind ourselves by a vow.
By that means shall we once more recover our power.”
</p>
<p>Mahaushadha saw them going thither, and reflected that, as they had gone somewhere
as if by common consent, they probably had in hand something never seen before. Having
suspected this, he sent the parrot Māṭhara<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3664src" href="#xd31e3664">19</a> after them, in order that it might find out what they were about, what they said
and did.
</p>
<p>When they had reached the park and there met together, they began to communicate to
each other their <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>faults and secrets, saying, “Now will we lend each other support.”
</p>
<p>“I ate the king’s peacock,” said one.
</p>
<p>“I sinned with the king’s wife,” said another.
</p>
<p>“I will do likewise,” said a third.
</p>
<p>After all six of them had revealed their secrets to each other, they partook of food
out of the same vessel.
</p>
<p>But the parrot Māṭhara reported all it had heard to Mahaushadha, and he reported it
to the king, who banished those ministers from the country.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While Bhagavant was dwelling in the region of Tushita, there lived in the city of
Nyagrodhika a highly respectable Brahman named Nyagrodha, whose means were so great
that he rivalled Vaiśravaṇa in wealth. He possessed sixteen slave villages, thirty
agricultural villages, sixty vegetable-garden villages, nine hundred and ninety-nine
pair of plough oxen, six hundred millions of gold pieces, and eighty golden earrings
capable of vying with those of King Mahāpadma. He had married a wife of birth like
unto his own, but their union remained childless. In order to obtain offspring he
appealed to all the gods, but without result.
</p>
<p>As he sat one day sorrowing, his mother advised him to go to the park and have recourse
to the deity of the thick-foliaged Nyagrodha tree from which the city took its name,
a tree provided with wide-spreading branches and a splendid crown.
</p>
<p>“Your father also remained childless [she said], although he had appealed for offspring
to many hundreds of thousands of gods. At length he betook himself to that Nyagrodha
tree, and after he had implored its aid you were born, and for that reason was the
name of Nyagrodha bestowed upon you.”
</p>
<p>So Nyagrodha also betook himself to that tree, and caused the ground around it to
be sprinkled, cleansed, and adorned. He then filled the space with perfumes, flowers,
and incense, and set up flags and standards. <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>Then, after having entertained eight hundred Brahmans and bestowed upon them materials
for robes, he prayed thus to the tree-haunting deity:—
</p>
<p>“Be pleased to bestow upon me a son. If a son is born unto me, I will pay thee boundless
honour after this fashion for the space of a year. But if no son is born unto me,
then will I cleave thee down to the level of beard-grass<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3702src" href="#xd31e3702">2</a> and split thee into chips. These will I burn, when they have been dried by the wind
and the sun, and their ashes will I scatter to the storm-wind or cast into the rolling
stream.”
</p>
<p>The deity, who was one of but small power, was well pleased with the prayer, and moreover
was afraid of being possibly driven away from that haunt. So, being in favour with
the four Mahārājas, the deity went to the Mahārāja Rāshṭrapāla, and besought him to
fulfil Nyagrodha’s request. Rāshṭrapāla considered that he could not do this, inasmuch
as the birth of sons and daughters takes place only in consequence of former actions.
So he betook himself, along with the deity of the tree, to Virūḍhaka, to Virūpāksha,
and to Vaiśravaṇa. But they likewise declared their incompetency. Then the four Mahārājas
betook themselves to Śakra, the prince of the gods, and said, “O Kauśika, a deity
belonging to our company is in danger of being driven from home. Be pleased on that
account to bestow a son on Nyagrodha, the respected Brahman of the city Nyagrodha.”
</p>
<p>Śakra replied that it did not lie in his power to bestow a son or daughter, seeing
that sons and daughters are born as a result of their own [previous] merits. Just
then the court of the gods was illuminated by a great radiance, at the sight of which
Śakra begged the four Mahārājas not to go away yet, for Mahābrahma was doubtless about
to appear. Then appeared Mahābrahma in youthful perfection, and took his place on
Śakra’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>bosom. He it is who fulfils all things which shall be accomplished. Then Śakra, the
prince of the gods, laid the palms of his hands together, and thus prayed to Mahābrahma:—
</p>
<p>“O Mahābrahma, art thou not Brahma, Mahābrahma, the ruler, the worker, the bestower,
the spell-wielder, the lord, the most high, and, as father of the worlds, the creator
of all beings? Lo, a deity belonging to our court, a dweller upon the earth, is in
danger of being driven away from a tree-habitation. Be pleased, therefore, to bestow
a son upon the respected Brahman Nyagrodha of the city of Nyagrodhika.”
</p>
<p>Mahābrahma reflected that he really could not confer on any one a son or a daughter,
but that, if he stated that he could not do so, then all the designations would be
discredited which it was customary to apply to him, such as Brahma, Mahābrahma, the
ruler, the worker, the bestower, and the spell-wielder. In case he should say that
he would bestow a son or daughter, inasmuch as he had no power to do so, it would
be requisite for him to take heed as to how he should accomplish that bestowing. With
that end he said privately to Śakra, the prince of the gods, “O Kauśika, neither has
the world made me, nor I the world.”
</p>
<p>Śakra replied, “O Mahābrahma, since this is so, inspect thy region, and if a being
is found there in the act of being subjected to the law of death, induce it to enter
into the womb in the house of the respected Brahman.”
</p>
<p>Brahma asked him why he did not inspect his own region. Śakra replied, “In the region
of Brahma the gods are known to be powerful, but those of this region are considered
powerless, and on account of their feebleness they would not venture to make their
entry.”
</p>
<p>When Brahma had given his consent, and had returned into his own region, he perceived
that the life of a certain <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>god was coming to an end, five prognostics thereof being visible. To him he spake
thus:—
</p>
<p>“O friend, as it appears that thou art departing from thy pleasant abode, and art
making a change, be so good as to enter into the womb in the house of the respectable
Brahman Nyagrodha in the city of Nyagrodhika. I will see that nothing shall be wanting
in the way of appointments.”
</p>
<p>The god replied in displeasure, “O Mahābrahma, release me from this obligation. Wherefore
this stress? Brahmans are addicted to perverse doctrines. He who wishes to come into
existence in the house of a Brahman is like unto one who from love of golden fetters
sets his own feet in bondage. Now will the Bodisat, after having thrice accomplished
the purification of the Kāmāvaćara gods, descend from the region of the Tushita gods,
and at midnight, as a snow-white elephant like unto the Airāvaṇa, with six tusks and
seven splendid limbs, enter the womb of Mahāmāyā, the wife of King Śuddhōdhana, in
that monarch’s <span class="corr" id="xd31e3724" title="Source: Śakya">Śākya</span> seat, not far distant from the hermitage of the Rishi Kapila, on the shore of the
Ganges, in the neighbourhood of the Himalaya. There will he be born, after the lapse
of ten full months, and, having become possessed of the highest and most consummate
wisdom, will set up the pillars of doctrine, will strike the drum of doctrine, and
will offer the sacrifice of doctrine. Therefore will I too, departing from here, make
my entry into some house of no account. Then going forth from it, renouncing the world,
I will enjoy in doctrine the drink of the gods. But were I to be born in the house
of a rich Brahman, and were to be his only son, no one would permit me to enter into
the clerical state. This being so, I do not hold it needful for me to be born of a
Brahman family.”
</p>
<p>“Even if this be so,” replied Mahābrahma, “thou wilt make thy entry there at my request.
At the fitting time will I, in that case, instruct thy parents aright.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon the god’s son gave his consent and entered the womb of Nyagrodha’s wife.
After the lapse of eight or nine months a fine boy was born and his birth-feast was
solemnised. In the city of Nyagrodha all stones, gravel, and rubbish were swept aside,
sandal-water was sprinkled, flowers of all sorts were strewn, incense was burnt in
censers filled with perfumes, standards, flags, silken ribbons and streamers were
hung out, markets for goods were provided, gifts were bestowed and benefits conferred
at the four gates and the cross-ways inside the city, food being bestowed upon those
who wanted food, drink upon those who desired drink, clothes upon those who needed
clothes, and garlands, perfumes, and ointments upon those by whom garlands, perfumes,
and ointments were required.
</p>
<p>After many gifts had been given and benefits conferred in this way during the space
of thrice seven, consequently of twenty-one days, the kinsmen assembled together,
and bestowed upon the boy the name of Nyagrodhaja, inasmuch as he had been obtained
in consequence of the prayer addressed to the Nyagrodha tree; but the Brahmans named
him Kāśyapa, as his father was of the Kāśyapa race.
</p>
<p>When he had grown up, and had partaken of instruction in all Brahman learning, his
father intrusted him with the instruction of five hundred Brahmans’ sons. Afterwards
his father reflected that it was the custom for Brahmans to live for forty-eight years
in chastity, and only in advanced life to enjoy their wives. But he wished to choose
a wife for his son betimes, in order that the great and rich race might be transmitted.
So he said to his son, “O son, as this is the law of the world, a wife must be taken
for the maintenance of the race.”
</p>
<p>“O father,” replied the son, “what shall I do with a wife? I will go into the forest
of penitence.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>However, as his father repeatedly maintained that the race must be transmitted, Kāśyapa
hit upon a means whereby he would seem not to be opposing the demands of his parents,
and yet would avoid consorting with his wife. He said to his father, “O father, order
gold from the river Jambu<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3738src" href="#xd31e3738">3</a> to be given to me.” His father sent for the treasurer, and ordered him to give his
son Nyagrodhaja as much Jambu-river gold as he required. The treasurer promised to
act in accordance with this command. Thereupon Nyagrodhaja called in an experienced
smith, and ordered him to make out of this gold the likeness of a woman. Then he gave
this image to his father, and said, “O father, if a maiden can be found resembling
this image, she shall become my wife. No other can I take as my wife.”
</p>
<p>As his father sat sorrowfully reflecting that it would be hard to find a maiden whose
appearance was like that of even ordinary gold, the young Brahmans saw him, and asked
what was the cause of his depression. He explained to them that it arose in consequence
of his son’s desire, one which his parents had never anticipated. They bade him be
of good cheer. A man thus disposed must be treated by similarly framed wise measures.
As he had caused an image of that kind to be prepared, his father ought to have three
others prepared in addition. With these four images they ought to be sent out into
the four quarters of the world. There could be no doubt that they would discover the
maiden.
</p>
<p>The Brahman followed their advice, and caused three additional images to be prepared.
The young Brahmans took the four images, and began wandering through villages, market-towns,
cities, and other places, and in them as they went they played upon divers musical
<span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>instruments. The Brahman Nyagrodha had given them directions not to choose a likeness
to the image out of an inferior caste and family. As they considered it would be impossible
for them to go from house to house, they determined to find out some other way of
proceeding. In the villages, market-towns, cities, and other places at which they
arrived, they always set up the image in the central point, and paid it reverence,
offering up incense, perfumes, flowers, and so forth, and letting music resound, and
they gave notice that it was the Goddess of Virgins who had arrived. To virgins who
paid her honour would she grant five wishes: birth in an exalted race, marriage into
an exalted race, residence in a fully provided house, submission on the part of the
husband, and the possession of children. When these words of theirs had become known,
crowds of maidens arrived, and with sacrifices and testimonies of honour they addressed
their prayers to the image.
</p>
<p>After some time, the young Brahmans who had gone towards the east, the north and the
south, came back without having met with any success. When the Brahman Nyagrodha saw
them return, he remained sitting where he was absorbed in thought. But his son Nyagrodhaja
was exceedingly joyful and said, “It is good that ye have found nothing.”
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the young Brahmans who had travelled westwards went on wandering through
villages, towns, lands, and capitals, till at length they came to the city of Kapila,
situated in the land of Kapila. In it lived a very rich Brahman named Kapila, to whom
there had been born, after he had married in his own degree, an extremely beautiful
daughter. To her, in accordance with the custom prevailing in <span class="corr" id="xd31e3750" title="Source: Madhyadesá">Madhyadeśa</span>, the name of Bhadrā was given on account of her beauty; and so, as her father’s name
was Kapila, she was called Kapilabhadrā. She had grown up by the time when those young
Brahmans <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>happened to arrive with their image, and set it up with all marks of honour in the
middle of the market-place, and the maidens of Kapila drew near to the Goddess of
Virgins, and prayed to her and brought her offerings. Among others, the wife of the
Brahman Kapila heard of this, and told her daughter to go and make an offering to
the Goddess of Virgins. She replied, “Of what use will it be if I make an offering
to the Goddess of Virgins?”
</p>
<p>“If you beseech her,” said her mother, “five kinds of things may be vouchsafed: birth
in an exalted race, marriage into an exalted race, residence in a fully provided house,
submission on the part of the husband, and possession of children.”
</p>
<p>To these words spoken by her mother Kapilabhadrā replied, “O mother, I come of an
exalted race and I am endowed with beauty. As I have no longing after any kind of
love, I do not see what I have to desire.”
</p>
<p>However, as her mother repeatedly urged her to go, Kapilabhadrā, in order to fulfil
her mother’s wishes, set out to visit the Goddess of Virgins, taking with her flowers,
incense, powders, robes, and the like. As she drew near to the image it became less
and less brilliant, so that by the time when she came up to it, it seemed as if it
were made of iron. When the young Brahmans had considered the question as to what
sort of change it was that had taken place, and by whose power it had been brought
about, they perceived that the brilliance [which had caused the change] proceeded
from that maiden. So they inquired of her whose daughter she was. “The Brahman Kapila’s
daughter Bhadrā,” she replied.
</p>
<p>Having learnt this, they betook themselves to the Brahman Kapila’s house, and remained
standing at its door asking for the bestowal of a gift. The Brahman Kapila thought
they were asking alms, so he gave orders that the young Brahmans should be presented
with meal of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>colour of māluta flowers, oil, grapes, pomegranates, and tamarinds. Now it is the
custom in Madhyadeśa for gifts from a father’s house to be distributed by his daughters.
This is done because people suppose that they obtain what is costliest by means of
the gift from the father’s house. So Kapilabhadrā came with the gifts to the spot
where the young Brahmans were begging, and offered them the gifts. But the young Brahmans
refused to accept them. Hearing this, the Brahman Kapila asked the young Brahmans
what it was they desired. They replied, “You should give us your daughter; we do not
want the gift of meal.” Then the Brahman Kapila angrily told those young Brahmans
that he would not give them his daughter. They explained that it was not for themselves
that they had requested the bestowal of his daughter. Thereupon the Brahman Kapila
declared that he could not understand the matter. Then the young Brahmans asked him
if he had never heard of the extremely rich and respected Brahman Nyagrodha, and his
exceedingly handsome and intelligent son, versed in all sciences, and said that it
was in that son’s behalf that they had asked for the daughter’s hand. Kapila replied
that he had in truth heard a full account of the virtues and attributes of the respected
Brahman, but that he did not see how an alliance could be entered into at such a distance.
The young Brahmans said in reply to this, “Honoured sir, have you never heard what
men are wont to say, ‘Fire, wind, a horse, a poison that runs along the veins, and
a Brahman of firm resolution, do not allow themselves to be stopped.’ That Brahman
is very rich, and you too are the same. You both have men and beasts for coming and
going. Moreover, enduring is the friendship which is contracted afar off.”
</p>
<p>When the Brahman youths had succeeded in rendering the Brahman Kapila well disposed
towards the Brahman Nyagrodha, he bestowed upon all of them towels, bricks <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>powder, sesamum-oil, combs, and other things used in bathing. The youths set out with
these things for the bathing pools outside the city of Kapila.
</p>
<p>While they were bathing, the Brahman Kapila bethought himself of taking counsel with
his friends and relations. So he went back into his house and told these things to
his wife and his kinsmen. They said, “This Brahman is highly distinguished, and therefore
we should be ready to take great pains in order to give him the daughter, even if
he had no desire to obtain her. All the more unreservedly, therefore, ought she to
be given to him now that he himself asks for her. If he enters into an alliance with
us and becomes her husband, the daughter also will be fortunate.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the parents betrothed their daughter to the Brahman youth Nyagrodhaja, having
previously bathed and put on white garments, and the prayers for good fortune and
happy results having been uttered by the Brahmans. The Brahman youths then informed
the maiden’s parents of the month, day, hour, and constellation at which the youth
would appear; and then, having completely attained their end, they joyfully set out
for Nyagrodhika.
</p>
<p>When they arrived there, the Brahman youth Nyagrodhaja, who had descried them from
afar, perceiving that they were joyful, said to himself that they had doubtless found
just such a maiden as he had thought of. The young Brahmans betook themselves to the
Brahman Nyagrodha, paid him reverence, and sat down. He welcomed them and asked, “Have
ye, O Brahman youths, obtained that which we proposed and hoped?”
</p>
<p>“O Pandit,” they joyfully replied, “be of good cheer; we have obtained what is far
more excellent than what you imagined. You instructed us to pay attention, not to
the maiden’s caste, family, and descent, but to her beauty. We have obtained one who
is endowed with beauty, caste, family, descent, and property.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Brahman youths then gave a full account of all the questions which had arisen,
and of how the name, day, hour, and constellation had been settled, adding, “As we,
O Pandit, have accomplished everything, and have returned back, now know, O Pandit,
that the time has arrived.” When the Brahman Nyagrodha had heard this report, he rejoiced
greatly, and bestowed upon the Brahman youths food, drink, clothes, and ornaments
of the very best kind.
</p>
<p>But when the Brahman youth Nyagrodhaja heard of the beauty and great brilliance of
this maiden, he was greatly disturbed, and he reflected that if her beauty was so
great, great also no doubt would be her passions. So he resolved to go and inspect
her beforehand. He said to his parents, “O my parents, I will bathe first at a bathing-place,
and will get married afterwards.” His parents gave their consent. Thereupon Nyagrodhaja,
accompanied by one young Brahman, set out from the city of Nyagrodhika for the city
of Kapila.
</p>
<p>When he had arrived there, and had recovered from the exertions of the journey, he
took the leaf of a tree, and began collecting alms throughout the city. Going from
house to house, he came to the door of the Brahman Kapila’s house. Thereupon Kapila’s
daughter Bhadrā came forth with a gift, and the Brahman youth Nyagrodhaja looked upon
her, and guessed that it was she.
</p>
<p>“Whose daughter are you?” he said to the maiden.
</p>
<p>“I am Kapila’s daughter,” she replied.
</p>
<p>“Are you betrothed to any one?”
</p>
<p>“I have heard,” she replied, “that my parents have given me in marriage to the son,
Nyagrodhaja by name, of the respected Brahman Nyagrodha, who dwells in the city of
Nyagrodhika.”
</p>
<p>“O Bhadrā,” said Nyagrodhaja, “what need have you of such a husband? Know that she
whose husband he will be will be just as if she had no husband.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>“How so?”
</p>
<p>“What can be done,” he replied, “with such a man as he, seeing that he has no craving
for any kind of love?”
</p>
<p>“Oh, sir, that is excellent,” she said. Then, after thinking awhile, “You have given
me back my life, you have entertained me with Amṛita,” she said aloud, “I too, O Brahman
youth, have no craving for any kind of love.” Moreover she said, “Your appearance
has become such a delight to me as is produced by neither delicious sandal nor rohiṇī
ointment, being great as is the distance between the rich man and the pauper. But
as I am powerless, and my parents have betrothed me, I know not what can be done.”
</p>
<p>Then said the Brahman youth Nyagrodhaja to Kapila’s daughter Bhadrā, “O Bhadrā, be
of good cheer! I myself am the Brahman youth Nyagrodhaja.”
</p>
<p>When Kapila’s daughter Bhadrā heard this, she was greatly comforted, and she said
to Nyagrodhaja, “O Brahman youth, enter in and confirm the vows. The virtuous keep
their vows.”
</p>
<p>After Nyagrodhaja and Kapila’s daughter Bhadrā had held counsel together thereon,
he went back to Nyagrodhika.
</p>
<p>After this, when the Brahman Nyagrodha had set his house in order, according to the
laws of householders, Nyagrodhaja married, and he and his wife were housed by his
parents in one and the same habitation, and in it two beds were provided for them.
Then said Nyagrodhaja to Kapila’s daughter Bhadrā, “O Bhadrā, remember the previously
taken vow.” And just the same did Bhadrā also say to Nyagrodhaja. After they had thus
admonished one another, they lived together like a mother and a son.
</p>
<p>The Brahman Nyagrodha and his wife asked the women-servants on what terms were their
son and his wife. They replied, “On those of a mother with her <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>son, a son with his mother.” When the Brahman and his wife heard this, he said, “That
is our fault, not the fault of those two. Why did we provide them with two beds?”
Then he gave orders that only one bed and one stool should be provided. Nyagrodhaja
saw that his parents had taken this step, which was antagonistic to the vow that had
been taken, and Kapila’s daughter <span class="corr" id="xd31e3795" title="Source: Bhadra">Bhadrā</span> perceived the intention of the parents. Then she said to Nyagrodhaja, “O lord, on
our account have these steps been taken; but be mindful of the previously taken vow.”
He replied, “Be of good cheer, and have no fear.” Then during the first part of the
night, Kapila’s daughter Bhadrā slept in the bed, and Nyagrodhaja sat on the stool.
During the second night watch, Nyagrodhaja slept while Bhadrā occupied the seat. In
the last watch Bhadrā again slept, but Nyagrodhaja remained awake sitting on the stool.
</p>
<p>The old people next took away the stool too. Then Kapila’s daughter Bhadrā again admonished
Nyagrodhaja as before. He replied, “Be without fear or care, and remain mindful of
the vow.” Thereupon Bhadrā slept during the first night-watch, but Nyagrodhaja walked
up and down. During the middle watch Nyagrodhaja slept, but Bhadrā walked up and down;
and in the last watch Bhadrā again slept, but Nyagrodhaja walked up and down.
</p>
<p>Thus for the space of twelve years they occupied the same single-bedded room without
an amorous thought ever arising in their minds. Then the king of the gods, Śakra,
thought, “As it is a very wonderful thing to see such a freedom from passion, I will
put these two to the test.” With this purpose he assumed the form of a snake, which
glided into their bedroom and coiled itself up under the bed. When Nyagrodhaja caught
sight of the black snake with terrible poison fangs under the bed, he feared that
it might do some harm. Now in her sleep <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>Bhadrā had let one of her hands hang down. Nyagrodhaja considered what could be done,
and lifted up her hand with the jewelled handle of the fly-flapper. Awakened and alarmed
by the touch of the handle, Bhadrā cried out in displeasure, “My lord, what means
this touch? Surely you have not touched me with amorous intent!”
</p>
<p>“Oh no, Bhadrā!” he replied, “but because I feared that this poisonous snake might
bite you did I lift up your hand.”
</p>
<p>“With what did you do so?” she asked.
</p>
<p>“With the jewelled fly-flapper’s handle,” he replied.
</p>
<p>“My lord,” she said, “better would it have been that the snake should have bitten
me than that you should have touched me with the jewelled fly-flapper’s handle.”
</p>
<p>“Why so?” he asked.
</p>
<p>“As a fair tree clasped by the māluta creeper perishes,” she replied, “so do men go
to ruin from a woman’s touch. Therefore is it better that one should be swiftly bitten
by the snake of death than that the hand of a man should touch an honourable woman.
In consequence of the contact of the king’s daughter’s body was the great ascetic
Ṛishyaśringa long ago deprived of the power he had gained by penance. On the path
of the storm-wind did he approach the king’s palace. He went back to the forest on
foot.”
</p>
<p>After the young couple had gone on living for some time in this fashion, the two old
people died. Then the Brahman youth Nyagrodhaja thought, “So long as my parents were
alive we had no cares, but now that they are dead we must manage the affairs of the
household ourselves.” So he told Bhadrā that she must take heed to the indoor affairs,
but that he would go and look after the fields.
</p>
<p>Now when he regarded the work done afield, he saw how the nine hundred and ninety-nine
pair of plough-oxen were tormented by small insects, how the oxen had <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>their nostrils bored through, their shoulders worn, their loins torn by the iron,
and how the labourers, long-haired and long-bearded, attired in garments of hemp,
had wales on their hands and feet, and, with bodies covered with dust, were like unto
burnt-out tree-stumps, and how, looking like Piśāchas, they abused and struck one
another for the sake of a plough or a ploughshare, on account of the use of the oxen
or the goad. So he went up to them and asked them to whom they belonged. They replied
that they were the labourers of the Brahman youth Nyagrodhaja. He asked by whom they
had been taken into service. They replied that they had been engaged, not by him,
but by his father, for the cultivation of his estate. Then said Nyagrodhaja to these
labourers, “O sirs, if ye were engaged by Nyagrodhaja’s father for the cultivation
of his estate, wherefore do ye labour with blows and abuse? If ye commit such misdeeds
with your bodies and your speech, are ye not afraid of suffering in a round of long
pains through the maturing of such conduct?”
</p>
<p>Then Nyagrodhaja resolved that he, sinning neither with the body nor in speech or
thought, would acquire merit. So when he had returned home, he said to Bhadrā, “O
Bhadrā, manage the household with care.”
</p>
<p>“O lord, what are you going to do?” she replied.
</p>
<p>“I am going into the forest of penance,” he said. Then he added the following verse:—
</p>
<p>“A small measure of cooked rice, a lonely couch, ensures bliss. A cotton double garment
is to be worn. All else is tinged with gloom.”
</p>
<p>For some time Bhadrā took charge of the household. Seeing the slave-women with wales
on their hands and feet, clad in hempen garments, with dishevelled hair, striking
each other with pestles on account of mortars, pestles, cooking-pits, and the like,
she asked them to whom they belonged. They replied, “To Kapila’s daughter, <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>Bhadrā.” Being asked if Bhadrā had chosen them herself, they replied that it was not
she but her mother-in-law who had taken them for the work of her household. Then she
also was moved; and, as at that time the Buddha was not yet born, she bestowed gifts
upon the Tīrthakas, Miniām̃sakas, Parivrajakas, Nirgranthas, Ājīvakas, Ash-bearers,
and so forth, and upon the poor and needy, and the askers for alms; so that the poor
were not poor, and the slave-women, the day-labourers, and the servants had no more
to cook.
</p>
<p>After dividing all his property among ministers, friends, relations, and connections,
Nyagrodhaja entered his house and inspected the clothes-room, with the intention of
choosing a humble garment. He took out from thence a large cotton robe worth a hundred
thousand pieces of money, and he gave a similar robe to Bhadrā, but the house he made
over to his kinsmen.
</p>
<p>Then said Nyagrodhaja to Bhadrā, “O Bhadrā, whither will you go?”
</p>
<p>“I will go together with you into the forest of penance,” she replied.
</p>
<p>“It is not allowable for me to live in the penance forest with a wife,” he said.
</p>
<p>“In that case,” replied Bhadrā, “let me be the first to go forth from the house.”
</p>
<p>“Why so?” he asked.
</p>
<p>“If you are the first to go forth from here,” said Bhadrā, “many men will long after
the wife, as after rice-soup that is ready for the table. It is not becoming that,
if you go away, other men should long after me.”
</p>
<p>Then the Brahman Nyagrodhaja thought, “This damsel is very discreet and of well-ordered
intelligence.” And he said to Bhadrā, “Bhadrā, come here; we will go forth from the
house together.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon they two went away from the house together. <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>After they had journeyed for a short time together, the husband said to the wife,
“O Bhadrā, go and live in whatever way pleases you.”
</p>
<p>At that time there lived in <span class="corr" id="xd31e3838" title="Source: Rajagṛiha">Rāajagṛiha</span> the Nirgrantha Pūraṇa, who asserted that he knew all that is unknown, and who was
surrounded by many Nirgranthas<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3841src" href="#xd31e3841">4</a> and Nirgrantha students. To him Bhadrā betook herself and said, “Reverend sir, I
wish to be received by you into the clerical order.” He received her, and she entered
among the Nirgranthas. When the Nirgranthas saw Bhadrā’s exquisite beauty, they said
to each other, “All we who have entered the clerical order have done so by reason
of the five powers of divine love. Now Kapila’s daughter Bhadrā looks like unto a
divine being, but we know not whether she has acquired the powers of divine love or
not. So we desire to enjoy the company of Kapila’s daughter Bhadrā.” Betaking themselves
to the Nirgrantha Pūraṇa, they explained the whole matter to him, and asked for Kapila’s
daughter Bhadrā. As a favour to his pupils he granted her to them. Thereupon the five
hundred Nirgranthas, in consequence of former actions, enjoyed her company every day.
Disquieted, she consulted Pūraṇa. He said, “Whom the lot betokens, with him have to
do.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>At that time Bhagavant, after enjoying himself in love as the Bodisat for twenty-nine
years, and then gazing upon age, disease, and death, had risen up at the midnight
hour, and betaken himself on the good steed Kaṇthaka to the forest, and, after enduring
for six years a penance of no avail, bathing in the river Nairaṅjanā, partaking of
the milk-food sixteen times purified by Nandā and Nandabalā, had been praised in verse
by the Nāgarāja Kāla, had received the Svastika <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>grass from the grass-seller, had betaken himself to the Bodhi tree without allowing
himself to be disturbed, and had without fear strewed the litter, taking his seat
with crossed legs as the sleeping Nāgarāja coils himself together, and there had remained
in this position till purification was attained, and had uttered words stirring his
soul. After he had there overcome Māra and a host of thirty-six tens of millions of
demons, he attained to the most complete insight, and became the perfect Buddha. Admonished
by Brahma, he betook himself to <span class="corr" id="xd31e3850" title="Source: Vārāṇaśī">Vārāṇasī</span>, and after he had set in movement the wheel of faith, he confirmed Ājnāna Kauṇḍinya
and eighty thousand gods in the truth, also he converted the troop of the Five, and
the followers of the Five, and fifty village youths. Having reached the cotton-tree
forest, he converted the sixty Bhadravargiyas; having reached Senānī, he confirmed
in the truth the two maidens Nandā and Nandabalā; having reached Uruvilvā, he converted
Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa and five hundred others by means of the eighteen magic transfigurations;
having reached Gāyā, he converted Nadīkāśyapa and a thousand wearers of matted hair
by means of three metamorphoses; having reached the Yashṭi forest, he converted King
Bimbisāra with his son and his court, eighty thousand gods, and many hundreds of thousands
of Brahmans and householders of Magadha. From Veṇuvana Bhagavant betook himself at
that time to Bahuputrachaitya. There Kāśyapa saw Bhagavant under a tree, and was received
by him. Kāśyapa gave him the costly cotton robe, and received the Buddha’s robe in
return.
</p>
<p>At the time of the festival of the meeting of the <span class="corr" id="xd31e3856" title="Source: Nāgārajas">Nāgarājas</span> Girika and Sundara, many Nirgranthas came to Rājagṛiha. When Kāśyapa perceived Kapila’s
daughter Bhadrā, as he remarked that her appearance was altered, he asked her whether
she had preserved her chastity. <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>After she had informed him of what had taken place, he invited her to turn her mind
towards the teaching of Bhagavant. As she hesitated, he assured her that this teaching
contained in it nothing sinful, for its followers experience no desire for the love
of gods, not to speak of that of men. He sent her to Mahāprajāpatī, who received her.
</p>
<p>When she next met him as she was collecting alms, she complained that, like a fat
sheep, she attracted universal attention on account of her beauty. Thereupon he told
her that she need not go out collecting alms in future; he would give her every day
half of what he himself collected. Thereat the Six scoffed. At length Bhadrā became
an Arhantin, and Mahākāśyapa gave her back her liberty to collect alms for herself.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Now, when Ajātaśatru had killed his father, and nothing sufficed to rouse him from
his sorrow, an evil minister, who remarked the beauty of Bhadrā, conceived the idea
that she might be able to gladden his heart. So he caused her to be seized while she
was out in quest of alms, and had her washed in one of the royal bath-houses, and
provided with royal perfumes, flower chaplets, raiment, and brilliant ornaments. Then
he conducted her to the king, who fell passionately in love with her as soon as he
saw her, and enjoyed himself with her.
</p>
<p>As Bhadrā was not present at the fifteenth Upavasatha,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3868src" href="#xd31e3868">5</a> Mahāprajāpatī ordered Utpalavarṇā to see after her. Utpalavarṇā introduced herself
into the palace through a window by means of magic, and instructed Bhadrā in magic.
Then Bhadrā betook herself, adorned with all her ornaments, to the summer residence
of the Bhikshuṇīs, where the Twelve mocked at this magnificent array. Mahāprajāpatī
ordered her to give the ornaments back to the king and to put on again the brown clerical
<span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>robe. When she reappeared at the palace, and the king, aroused from sleep, wished
to embrace her, she raised herself heavenward by magic means. When he saw her thus
soaring, fear came upon him. He uttered cries of anguish, and asked her whether she
was a goddess, a Nāgī, a Yakshiṇī, or a Rākshasī. At his request she swept down again.
He fell at her feet, and she granted him the forgiveness for which he prayed.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in Takshaśilā a very rich householder, to whom his wife bore a daughter
of great beauty. As the child’s eyes were like blue lotus blossoms, and as she exhaled
a lotus-like fragrance, while the colour of her body resembled that of the lotus stamen,
her relations gave her the name of Utpalavarṇā.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3887src" href="#xd31e3887">2</a> As her father had no son, he determined that, when his daughter was grown up, he
would give her in marriage only to one who, on becoming his son-in-law, would take
up his abode with him.
</p>
<p>There was also in Takshaśilā another householder, who died leaving a son behind him.
This son, while wandering about after the death of his parents, entered the house
of Utpalavarṇā’s father, who proposed to him that he should take up his residence
with him as his son-in-law, whereto he consented.
</p>
<p>After the death of Utpalavarṇā’s father, her mother, who had food and clothing in
plenty, experienced amorous desires. But she had scruples about inviting a stranger
into the house, so she determined to allure her own son-in-law. Understanding the
hints she gave him, he complied with her desires.
</p>
<p>Being just on the point of being confined, Utpalavarṇā told her maid to call her mother.
But when the maid came to the mother’s chamber, she found her and her son-in-law alone
together, so she determined to wait <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>awhile. When the mother came forth from the chamber, the maid told her that Utpalavarṇā
had ordered her to be called. When the maid got back, she found that her mistress
had given birth to a daughter, and she was asked what had detained her. The maid replied,
“May your mother and your husband remain well!” Being asked what she meant by that,
the maid related what had taken place. Utpalavarṇā imagined that the maid calumniated
her husband and her mother; but the maid said that, as she was not believed, she would
make the matter manifest to her; so when the mother and her son-in-law were alone
together, the maid called in Utpalavarṇā. When Utpalavarṇā saw those two together
she thought, “Has this wretched woman seen no other man in Takshaśilā, that she keeps
company with her son-in-law? And has this wretched man seen no other woman in Takshaśilā,
that he keeps company with his mother-in-law?” Full of wrath, she cried aloud to her
husband, “Wretched man, henceforth do what you please with her!” With these words
she flung her new-born daughter to her husband. The babe glanced off from the father’s
body and fell on the threshold, whereby its head was wounded. But Utpalavarṇā veiled
herself and left the house.
</p>
<p>Seeing a caravan starting for Mathurā, she joined it. The caravan-leader, becoming
ardently enamoured of her on account of her beauty, asked her to whom she belonged.
She replied that she belonged to him who gave her food and clothing. So he took her
to wife, and when they at length came to Mathurā, he left her there.
</p>
<p>When he had sold his goods, and had returned to Takshaśilā with the money, the other
merchants exchanged hospitable invitations and entertained one another. As the caravan-leader
offered no such entertainment, the merchants asked him why he did not do so. He replied,
“Ye who have your housewives with you are indeed able to entertain, but as I have
no one <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>who could undertake the trouble for me, I do not know how I can entertain.” The merchants
were of opinion that, under these circumstances, he ought to look out for a damsel.
He replied, “If I can find a damsel like my wife, I will marry her.” They begged him
to describe his wife’s appearance. He did so, and they perceived that he had a jewel
of a wife, but they said that they would bestir themselves to discover one like her.
Perceiving that Utpalavarṇā’s own daughter answered to that description, they asked
for the maiden’s hand on behalf of the caravan-leader. Her relatives said, “Honoured
sirs, we are ready to give her; but in case he discovered anything to find fault with
in her after you have received her from us, he might send her back and go away.” The
merchants gave an assurance that this would not be the case, and then the girl was
made over to them, and the caravan-leader married her.
</p>
<p>Having disposed of his goods, he set off with the proceeds for Mathurā. Coming to
a certain rock not far from the city, he left his goods there, together with the girl,
saying that he was obliged to go for a short time to Mathurā.
</p>
<p>There Utpalavarṇā greeted him and asked after his welfare. He began to complain that
he had been robbed. She was delighted that he himself had arrived in safety, and said
that the god of wealth would assist him later on. After some time he said, “O fair
one, I must go to look for the goods of which I have been robbed.” She gave her consent.
Scarcely had he gone when one of the friends of his youth arrived and asked Utpalavarṇā
where he had gone. She told him that he had gone to look for the goods which had been
stolen from him. Thereupon he informed her that her husband had never completed a
journey with such freedom from loss as on this occasion, and that he had deceived
her. Moreover, he related to her how her husband had brought with him <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>from Takshaśilā a Gandhāra<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3910src" href="#xd31e3910">3</a> woman whose feet she was not worthy to wash. When the friend had affirmed the truth
of his assertions she remained sitting in silence.
</p>
<p>When the caravan-leader came back she passed over the slight and asked him if he had
recovered his goods. He replied that he had. Then she said, “O master, you have deceived
me. Your goods have not been stolen. I have heard that you have brought with you a
Gandhāra woman from Takshaśilā. Bring her here. For soon come to an end the means
of him who resides in two places.”
</p>
<p>“O fair one,” he replied, “that is true, indeed; but have not you heard that in the
house of a man who has two wives the soup is often cold, and therefore cannot be relished,
and that in that house are found strife, discord, and bickering?”
</p>
<p>“O master,” she said, “pay no heed to that. It shall not be so. Only bring her here.
If she is like a younger sister, I will look on her as a sister. If she is like a
daughter, as a daughter will I regard her.”
</p>
<p>The caravan-leader complied with her request and fetched the girl, and on her appearance
Utpalavarṇā conceived affection for her. One day, when she was dressing the girl’s
hair, she perceived a scar on her head, and asked her what had caused it.
</p>
<p>“I know nothing about it,” replied the girl, “except that my grandmother has told
me that my mother once tossed me to my father in a fit of passion, and I fell upon
the threshold, and that was how the scar was produced.”
</p>
<p>“What is your grandmother’s name?”
</p>
<p>“So and so.”
</p>
<p>“And your mother’s?”
</p>
<p>“Utpalavarṇā.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Utpalavarṇā thought, “As there I was mother and joint-wife, and here my daughter
is joint-wife, I must anyhow depart.” So she veiled her head and went away from the
house.
</p>
<p>Seeing that a caravan was starting for Vaiśālī she attached herself to it, entered
into intimate relations with the merchants, and arrived at Vaiśālī together with them.
When the courtesans residing in Vaiśālī asked why the merchants from Mathurā had nothing
to do with them, one of their number said, “Is it not because they have brought with
them a Gandhāra woman of such beauty that we are not worthy to wash her feet?” Then
they all assembled and betook themselves to Utpalavarṇā and invited her, as her vocation
was the same as theirs, to enter among them. Utpalavarṇā laid aside her head-dress
and straightway went unto them.
</p>
<p>As they sat one day at the drinking-board they discoursed about the various merchants
whom they had relieved of divers sums. Now there lived in Vaiśālī a young grocer named
Anishtaprāpta, whom none of them had as yet been able to allure. They said, “Whoever
amongst us succeeds in alluring the young grocer, her will we style a capable woman.”
Utpalavarṇā asked whether in case she succeeded in alluring him, they would recognise
her as their mistress. They replied that they would; in return for which she promised
that if she failed she would pay sixty Kārshāpaṇas.
</p>
<p>Having hired an apartment near the grocer’s dwelling, she gave her maid instructions
to buy perfumes from him every day. In case he asked her for whom she bought them,
she was to reply that a young man of good family had come to Utpalavarṇā’s house,
and that it was for him that they were intended. The maid acted in accordance with
these instructions. After a time, Utpalavarṇā told her maid to procure from the same
young man, bitter, acid, and tart drugs. If he asked for whom they were <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>intended, she was to say that the young man of good family was ill, and that she had
bought the drugs for him. If he asked whose money it was that was paid, she was to
say that Utpalavarṇā paid it. The maid did as she ordered. When the grocer saw that
Utpalavarṇā was providing for the invalid out of her own means, he conceived a liking
for her, and told her maid to let her know that he wished to pay her a visit. She
executed the commission, but Utpalavarṇā told her to say to him that the young man
of good family was not yet cured.
</p>
<p>As the grocer repeatedly inquired on what day he might come, Utpalavarṇā perceived
that he had conceived a strong passion for her, and she resolved to carry out an elaborate
piece of deceit. She made a man’s figure of grass, and had it taken to the cemetery
and there burnt. Then she went, wailing and with dishevelled locks, close by the shop
of that grocer, where he was able to see her. According to the words of Bhagavant,
women enchain men in eight ways; by dancing, singing, playing, laughing, weeping,
and by their appearance, their touch, and their questions. Excited by strong passion,
the grocer said to the maid, “O maiden, now will I go.” The maid asked her mistress,
who replied, “Go, maiden, and say to him, ‘The young man of good family died to-day,
and the mourning is not yet over. How then can you pay me a visit?’ ”
</p>
<p>When the maid had executed her commission, the young man’s longing to see Utpalavarṇā
increased. Then she sent to tell him he was not to visit her in her house. But she
made an appointment with him at a spot in the park. The grocer went to the park, taking
with him quantities of food, drink, raiment, and garlands. After he had eaten and
drunk for a while with Utpalavarṇā, and was no longer master of his senses, being
overcome by the power of wine, she determined that she would let him be seen by the
public. So she set a wreath on <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>his head, threw her arms round his neck, and convoyed him home. When the courtesans
saw this, they were astonished and said, “This Gandhāra woman has splendidly beguiled
the young grocer,” and they named her their mistress.

<p>After having for some time led a life of pleasure in the company of the other courtesans,
she became in the family way. Now there were two gate-keepers at Vaiśālī, one for
the east gate, the other for the west gate. As they were on very friendly terms with
each other, and they wished this state of things to be continued as much as possible,
even after their death, they agreed that their children should be united in marriage.
When at the end of nine months Utpalavarṇā had given birth to a son, she reflected
that women who had young children were avoided by men. So she said to her maid, “Go,
maiden, take this child and a lamp, and deposit them both at a certain spot by the
roadside, and then wait till some one takes up the child.” The maid took the child,
and laid it down at a spot near the abode of the eastern warder. Then she placed the
lamp beside the child, and remained on the watch. When the eastern warder saw the
lamp, he suspected what had taken place, and betook himself to the spot. Seeing the
child, he took it up in his arms, and carried it to his wife, saying, “Good wife,
there is a son for you.” Thereat she was greatly pleased. When the morning came, and
found sounds of rejoicing still continuing, the neighbours asked one another why there
was such rejoicing in the eastern warder’s house. Some said that a child had been
born therein, others asked where the child could have come from, seeing that his wife
had certainly not been in the family way. When the western warder heard of it, he
reflected that, if a daughter should be born to him, the eastern warder’s son would
become his daughter’s husband; so he sent a present of raiment and ornaments. As for
the boy, he <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>throve apace, and when he was grown up he entered an association.
</p>
<p>Some time after the birth of her son, Utpalavarṇā again became in the family way,
and at the end of nine months bore a daughter, with whom she dealt just as she had
done with the boy. Her maid abandoned the child by the roadside near the western warder’s
house, and he took it to his wife, who received it joyfully. And the eastern warder,
seeing in the girl the future wife of his son, sent her raiment and ornaments. The
girl throve apace, and when she grew up also entered an association.
</p>
<p>It happened one day that five hundred associates were going to visit a park, and as
they took counsel together the idea occurred to them of taking a courtesan along with
them, and they resolved to invite the Gandhāra woman, stipulating that if any of their
number would have nothing to do with her, he should pay the associates sixty kārshāpaṇas.
When they had agreed with Utpalavarṇā for five hundred kārshāpaṇas, and had taken
her to the park, only the eastern warder’s son had no inclination towards her. Then
Utpalavarṇā said to him, “Sir, take your pleasure, else must you pay the sixty kārshāpaṇas.”
The fear of this penalty induced him to surrender himself to enjoyment. Afterwards
an affection for Utpalavarṇā arose within him, and he made her his concubine. Thereat
the Liććhavis were greatly angered, and they wanted to put him to death for having
made a courtesan his concubine. Every one possesses in the world friends, foes, and
persons indifferent to him. He betook himself to the eastern warder, and told him
what had occurred. The eastern warder was terrified. He went to the Liććhavis, fell
at their feet, and implored their favour for his son. As the eastern warder had for
a long time been of service to them, they consented to give the courtesan to his son,
in case he loved her. Thereupon the eastern warder’s son, their permission <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>being assured to him, was no longer alarmed, and made Utpalavarṇā his wife.
</p>
<p>His father afterwards said to the western warder, “O friend, give your daughter to
my son as his wife.” The other replied, “What does your son want with another wife,
seeing that he is already married.” The eastern warder answered, “Inasmuch as we have
already agreed thereto, give your daughter to him. As I have sufficient means, I will
set the house of my son’s wife on an excellent footing.” So the western warder, in
accordance with the agreement, gave his daughter to the eastern warder’s son as his
wife. About that time <span class="corr" id="xd31e3957" title="Source: Ayushmant">Āyushmant</span> Maudgalyāyana<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3960src" href="#xd31e3960">4</a> came to the eastern warder’s house. And when he saw the warder’s daughter-in-law,
he cried, “O daughter, your fellow-wife is your mother. Your husband is your brother.
But be not over troubled, and entertain no thoughts about hell.”
</p>
<p>When Utpalavarṇā had lived some time with her husband, there was born unto her a son.
The daughter [of the western warder] used to set the babe in sport, before the door
of the house. There came along the road a Brahman who, after looking at her, asked
her in verse, how the boy was related to her. She answered him, also in verse—
</p>
<p>“O Brahman, he is my brother, the son of my brother, my son [<i>i.e.</i>, step-son], and my brother-in-law. His father is my father [<i>i.e.</i>, step-father], my brother, and now my husband.”
</p>
<p>Overhearing this, Utpalavarṇā asked the maidservant what those two were saying. The
maid replied, “What those two are saying is the truth and no lie.”
</p>
<p>“What then, is the truth?” asked Utpalavarṇā.
</p>
<p>“Your son,” replied the maid, “whom I exposed at the east gate is now your husband.
Your daughter, whom I exposed at the west gate, is now your fellow-wife.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Utpalavarṇā reflected that formerly she <span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>had been mother and fellow-wife, and her daughter had been her fellow-wife, and that
her son was now her husband, wherefore, she must at any rate depart. So she veiled
her head, and left the house.
</p>
<p>As a caravan was just setting out for Rājagṛiha, she attached herself to it, and travelled
along with it to Rājagṛiha, where she lived as before as a courtesan. An association
of five hundred youths, who were going to a park one day, invited the Gandhāra woman
to go there with them, on the payment of five hundred <span class="corr" id="xd31e3980" title="Source: karshāpāṇas">kārshāpaṇas</span>. There they ate and drank and enjoyed themselves with her.
</p>
<p>Now <span class="corr" id="xd31e3985" title="Source: Ayushmant">Āyushmant</span> Maudgalyāyana knew that the time for Utpalavarṇā to be converted was at hand, and
he wandered up and down at a little distance from those young men. Then said the young
men, “This worthy Maudgalyāyana is freed from the bonds of sin, but we are sunk in
the slough of passion.”
</p>
<p>“In Vaiśālī,” said Utpalavarṇā, “I beguiled the young grocer Anishṭaprāpta.”
</p>
<p>“Will you beguile this man also?” asked the youths.
</p>
<p>She asked how much they would pay her in case she beguiled him. They promised her
five hundred <span class="corr" id="xd31e3992" title="Source: karshāpāṇas">kārshāpaṇas</span>. And in return she bound herself to become the concubine of one of the members of
the association if she failed. All this was agreed to. Then Utpalavarṇā betook herself
to the spot where Mahāmaudgalyāyana was, and employed all kinds of feminine tricks
and artifices. But Mahāmaudgalyāyana’s senses remained unbeguiled. Then she reflected
that a woman’s touch is of the nature of poison, so she determined to embrace him,
and thereby to bring him into her power. But when she tried to do so, Mahāmaudgalyāyana
soared aloft with outstretched wings like a flamingo-king. And by the words which
he spoke was Utpalavarṇā so affected that she besought him to instruct her in the
doctrine. He did so, and she recognised the four truths.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A rich householder of Vārāṇasī named Gautama, who travelled with goods to Takshaśilā,
contracted a friendship there with another householder, and the two men made an agreement
that their children should marry each other. To Gautama was born a daughter, who received
the name of Kṛiśā Gautamī. After she had been taught to read, she had to apply herself
to learning such work as women do. Now her father had been in the habit of associating
with courtesans, so he entrusted his daughter’s instruction to a woman of that class.
The daughter began to study with her. After she had done so for some time she said,
“As I have acquired what was to be learnt, I will go away.” But the woman objected
that she must first complete her studies properly; it was too soon for her to go away
yet. The girl replied that she had already studied enough, and that she would go away.
Then the woman took a paint-box and said that she would give herself a broken head
if the girl was determined to go away. The girl begged her not to do that, and promised
to remain. Then said the woman, “Kṛiśā, you believed that you had learnt everything,
and yet you did not <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>know this. Who would give herself a broken head for the sake of a stranger child?
You know nothing then.”
</p>
<p>After the girl had tarried with her somewhat longer, she wanted to go away again.
The woman declared that if that happened she would jump into the well. The girl besought
her not to do that, and promised to stay. The woman said, “Kṛiśā, you believed that
you had learnt everything, and you did not even know so much as this, that no one
jumps into a well for the sake of a strange child. As you did not know that, you must
stop here.”
</p>
<p>After the girl had stayed there some time longer, she again wanted to go away. The
woman said that she need not wait long. She was going to bring in some milk, she said.
The girl could drink it and then go away. The woman brought the milk, and in the girl’s
presence mixed oil and honey with it. Then she drank some of it, and having done so,
rendered it loathsome, and told the girl to drink it. The girl refused to do so, whereupon
the woman took to crying. When the neighbours heard this, they came together and asked
her why she was crying. When the woman had explained the matter, the neighbours asked
the girl why she would not drink the milk which had been prepared for her. The girl
replied that she could not swallow what was loathsome. Thereupon the woman smote her
breast repeatedly and said, “Wherefore should I give her what is loathsome to drink?”
The neighbours seriously set to work to make the girl drink. But when she was going
to drink, the woman seized her by the hand, slapped her face with the palm of her
hand, and said, “O Kṛiśā, you believed that you had learnt all that was to be learnt.
If that had been the case, you would certainly never have let that be given you to
drink which you knew was loathsome. Consequently you know nothing.” Having thus spoken,
she drove the girl away.
</p>
<p>After some time a merchant and five hundred traders <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>came to Madhyadeśa with merchandise. In the presence of these traders the merchant
constantly spoke against women. Those traders had previously consorted with the courtesans
of that place. But the courtesans now found that they and their leader only scoffed
at women, and visited no courtesan’s house. So they held counsel together, saying
that whereas the traders who formerly came from Takshaśilā used to have converse with
them, they were now entirely devoid of all passion. And so no man consorted with the
women. Some of the courtesans said that they had heard that the merchant, who knew
how to repress passion, blamed women severely, and that the traders, who were devoted
to him, had therefore discontinued all converse with them. One of their number, an
old woman, asked, “If I, by means of my daughter, effect a change in him, will ye
make me your superior? And, in case she did not succeed, she promised to pay a penalty
of five hundred kārshāpaṇas.<span class="corr" id="xd31e4027" title="Not in source">”</span>
</p>
<p>Thereupon the old woman hired a house in the neighbourhood of the traders, and provided
it with a great quantity of domestic implements. The merchant’s servants used to go
there and borrow some of those implements. She said to them: “Who are ye, young men?”
</p>
<p>They replied: “We serve the merchant from Takshaśilā.”
</p>
<p>She said: “O youths, my son also is a merchant, and he has travelled into another
land with merchandise. As I suppose that his servants, like yourselves, are borrowing
implements from other people, ye are at liberty to use all the utensils which are
in this house, just as if they were your own.”
</p>
<p>So the servants made daily use of those utensils, and when the merchant had asked
them whence they obtained them, and they had repeated to him the old woman’s words,
a friendly feeling was excited within him, and he <span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>said: “As she has shown you kindness, she shall be my mother.” They told the old woman
that their master prized her kindness highly, and regarded her as his mother. Thereupon
she said that it would be desirable for her to become acquainted with him, and she
asked them to invite the merchant to her house. There she received him with friendly
words, saying that she found that he was like her son in appearance, and that he also
bore the same name as her son, so that there was no difference between the two. Afterwards
she told the wife of the master of the house to send for her daughter, whom she ordered
to manifest her respect for her [adopted] brother. When the maiden appeared, and the
merchant perceived her beauty, he desired to obtain her as his wife. The old woman
said that there was only this drawback; that, as he was not regularly known to her,
he might, if he married her daughter, leave her in the lurch. And so, for her security,
she demanded that he should bring all his goods into her house. Agreeing to this,
he brought his goods into her house. But the old woman immediately took them out of
it by another door. When this was done, she promised to give him her daughter.
</p>
<p>On the appointed day, and at the appointed hour, she invited the courtesans, adorned
with all kinds of ornaments, to the wedding feast, during which they wandered to and
fro. The merchant said: “Mother dear, are there only women here, and not a single
man?” She yawned. One of the others secretly whispered into his ear: “O merchant,
do you not perceive what is going on here? All these women are courtesans. How should
there be any man present?” Then he perceived that he had really taken a courtesan
to wife, and consequently that he had been duped. Moreover the girl demanded payment
from him for her society. But he replied that the whole of his property had been taken
away, and that he had no money besides.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he had gone fast asleep, the old woman wrapped him up in a mat and deposited
him in the middle of the market-place. When the daylight arrived, and many of the
people who dwelt in the city began to come and go, he awoke, and, seeing how he had
been treated, he gave way to despair. With eyes filled with tears, he wandered through
the squares, the streets, and the roads of Vārāṇasī, and, plagued by hunger, in order
to obtain food, he went to the spot where the day-labourers betook themselves. At
that time the householder Gautama was building himself a house. As he was looking
for day-labourers, the young merchant was brought up to him by one of the others.
But the youth seemed to him too young and too little accustomed to work of that kind,
so he ordered another man to be sought for. But the youth looked Gautama in the face
with tearful eyes. Then Gautama asked him who he was, and whence he came. Full of
grief at his pitiful condition, with tearful eyes and choking voice, he slowly said:
“O father, as the result of former deeds did I prosperously arrive here from the northwards
lying city of Takshaśilā. But now I know not whither I shall go, nor do I know how
I shall get back there.” When the householder Gautama perceived how cast down he was,
and understood what he said, he felt kindly disposed towards him, and asked him if
he knew many persons in Takshaśilā. Receiving an affirmative reply, he asked him if
he knew such and such a householder. “O father, I know him, for he is my own father,”
answered the merchant. The householder Gautama was greatly pleased, and told the youth
that he must not mourn or weep, adding, “As you shall be my son-in-law, this house
shall belong to you.” Then the youth took courage, and gave up being mournful. Gautama
conferred upon him food, drink, clothes, and ornaments, a dwelling-house and a storehouse,
and friendly words. And he said to his wife, “O good one, your <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>son-in-law has come. As the wedding is about to take place, have all things in readiness.”
Thereupon he was going to fix the day and hour for the wedding, but the youth bade
him wait a little longer, as he wished to get possession of his property first. Gautama
wanted to prevent him from doing that, saying there was property enough in the house.
But he replied: “What shall I do with the property?” As he wished to revenge himself
upon the courtesan, he said: “O father, as this is so, I will not marry after the
fashion of a man of low family.” Thereupon he left Vārāṇasī.
</p>
<p>As he wandered this way and that, he came to the bank of a river, and saw a corpse
floating in the water. A raven, which was on the bank, and which wanted to feed on
the corpse, could not reach it with its beak. Thereupon it rubbed its beak on a piece
of wood, and the beak lengthened. Then the raven fed upon the corpse. Afterwards the
raven rubbed its beak upon another piece of wood, and then the beak returned to its
former length. The merchant took pieces of those two kinds of wood, and returned home.
</p>
<p>He then took five hundred kārshāpaṇas and went to the house of that courtesan, and
said to her: “O fair one, as I had no money, you turned me out of the house. Now,
as I have money, come let us be friends.” She, who cared for money, made friends with
him. Meanwhile, however, the merchant rubbed the wood on her nose, which became very
long. She called in all the doctors, and showed them her nose, but none of them could
cure her. Given up by all the doctors, she betook herself to the merchant, and begged
him to forgive her, and to cure her nose. He replied that he would do so as soon as
she had restored him his property. She promised to do so in the course of the day.
He rubbed her nose with the second piece of wood, the nose became as it had been before.
Then she gave him back all the <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>goods which he had brought with him. After that the merchant, with very great joy,
took Kṛiśā Gautamī to wife.
</p>
<p>The householder Gautama possessed some arable land in a hill district, and he bade
his son-in-law go thither with his wife. When the time came for the wife to expect
her confinement, her husband allowed her, at her request, to go to her parents’ house,
in order that she might there be cared for by her mother. After her confinement and
the naming of her boy, she returned with him to her husband.
</p>
<p>When the time of her second confinement drew near, she again expressed a desire to
go to her parents’ house. Her husband set off with her and the boy in a waggon, but
when they had gone half-way she gave birth to a boy. When her husband saw that this
was about to take place, he got out of the waggon, sat down under a tree, and fell
asleep. While he was completely overcome by slumber, a snake bit him, and he died.
When his wife in her turn alighted from the waggon, and went up to the tree, in order
to bring her husband the joyful tidings that a son was born unto him, he, as he had
given up the ghost, made no reply. She seized him by the hand, and found that he was
dead. Then she began to weep. Meantime a thief carried off the oxen.
</p>
<p>After weeping for a long time and becoming very mournful, she looked around on every
side, pressed the newborn babe to her bosom, took the elder child by the hand, and
set out on her way. As a heavy rain had unexpectedly fallen, and all lakes, ponds,
and springs were full of water, and the road was flooded by the river, she reflected
that if she were to cross the water with both the children at once, she and they might
meet with a disaster, and therefore the children had better be taken over separately.
So she seated the elder boy on the bank of the river, and took the younger one in
her <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>arms, walked across to the other side, and laid him down upon the bank. Then she went
back for the elder boy. But while she was in the middle of the river, the younger
boy was carried off by a jackal. Standing in the middle of the river, the mother waved
her hands, trying to scare away the jackal. The elder boy thought that his mother
was calling him, and sprang into the water. The bank was very steep, so he fell down
and was killed. The mother hastened after the jackal, which let the child drop, and
ran off. When she looked at it, she found that it was dead. So after she had wept
over it, she threw it into the water. When she saw that her elder son was being carried
along by the stream, she became still more distressed. She hastened after him, and
found that he also was dead. Bereft of both husband and children, she gave way to
despair, and sat down alone on the bank, with only the lower part of her body covered.
There she listened to the howling of the wind, the roaring of the forest and of the
waves, as well as the singing of various kinds of birds. Then wandering to and fro,
with sobs and tears of woe, she lamented the loss of her husband and the two children.
</p>
<p>As every action by gradual steps approaches maturity, so it came to pass that at that
time her parents, along with their numerous domestics, were destroyed by a hurricane,
only one man escaping with his life. When she, weeping and wailing, suddenly came
upon that man, and saw him all aghast, she asked what was the matter. He smote his
breast before her, and, sobbing and weeping, told her what had happened. When she
had heard that, she again began to weep and wail, and asked what sin she had committed
in her earlier existence, that she should have lost all at once her husband and her
children, as well as all her relatives. And she came to the conclusion that she ought
not to live any longer at home, seeing that her misery would only become greater there.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>So she wandered about till she came to a hill village, where she took up her abode
with an old woman who span cotton. And after recovering from her fatigue she took
to spinning along with her.
</p>
<p>There was in that village a young weaver who lived by his craft, and who was in the
habit, from time to time, of buying cotton yarn from that old woman. One day, when
she had served him with fine yarn, he asked her whence that came, seeing that she
formerly span him only coarse yarn. She told him about the woman who was living in
her house; thereupon he expressed a wish to take that woman as his wife, and to provide
her with food and clothing and other necessaries of life. The old woman, after having
received from him the money for the yarn and food, bade him wait for an answer; then,
perfumed, and adorned with flowers, she went to Kṛiśā Gautamī and told her the whole
story, praising the qualities of the weaver, saying that he asked her to be his wife,
and advising her to accept his proposal. Although at first she opposed the idea, yet
at last she gave in, and the marriage took place. Now the weaver was a rough, passionate
man, who used constantly to beat her with his fist and with a stick; so she told the
old woman that she had married her to a Rākshasa, and that she did not know what she
should do, for he beat her every day with his hand and with a stick. The old woman
comforted her, and said that he would beat her only so long as no son was born to
him, but that later on she and her son would hold their own. When she was in the family
way the weaver began to treat her kindly, but she treated him with contempt: with
that, however, he put up.
</p>
<p>One day the weaver, whom his friends had liberally treated with intoxicating beverages,
came home dazed with drink. He found the door closed: his wife was just on the point
of being confined, and when he called out to her to open the door, her pains prevented
her from being <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>able to do so, so he went away in great wrath. When her child was born she opened
the door, and as soon as her husband came in she joyfully told him of the birth of
their son. But he, whose rage was not yet appeased, being overcome by evil, declared
that she, who had already despised him before the son’s birth, would put him to death,
in collusion with her son, after the son had grown up. Then he ordered her to light
a fire, and set a cauldron over it, and to pour oil into the cauldron and make it
boil, and then to fling the new-born babe into the oil and boil it. When she remonstrated
with him; begging that he would not kill his own child, he beat her with a stick.
Overcome by this cruelty, she threw the child into the boiling oil. When it was cooked
he ordered her to take it out and eat its flesh. When she refused, he beat her most
severely all over her body, whereupon she ate the child’s flesh. When her husband’s
rage was appeased, and he was full of remorse and overcome by sleep, Kṛiśā Gautamī
took as much food as she could carry, and went away.
</p>
<p>She attached herself to some travellers from the north who had disposed of their goods
in Vārāṇasī. Remarking her beauty, their caravan-leader conceived a passion for her,
and asked her who she was and whither she was going. She replied, “My husband has
been bitten by a snake; of my two sons, one has been carried off by a jackal, and
the other has perished in the waters; and my father and my mother have been killed
by a storm. I, who am now without any protector, am wandering at will, and I am going
to journey along with this company of travellers.” The caravan-leader made her his
wife. Soon afterwards the travellers were suddenly attacked by robbers, in fighting
with whom the caravan-leader was killed, and Kṛiśā Gautamī became the wife of the
robber chief. But in his turn the robber found his death at the hands of the king
of that country, and Kṛiśā Gautamī <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>was transferred to the king’s zenana. The king died, and she was buried alive in his
tomb, after having had great honour shown her by the women, the princes, the ministers,
and a vast concourse of people. Some men from the north country, who were wont to
rob graves, broke into this one also. The dust they raised entered into Kṛiśā Gautamī’s
nostrils, and made her sneeze. The grave-robbers were terrified, thinking that she
was a Vetāla, and they fled; but Kṛiśā Gautamī escaped from the grave through the
opening which they had made. Conscious of all her troubles, and affected by the absence
of provisions, just as a violent storm arose, she went out of her mind. Covered with
merely her underclothing, her hands and feet foul and rough, with long locks and pallid
complexion, she wandered about until she reached <span class="corr" id="xd31e4068" title="Source: Śravastī">Śrāvastī</span>.
</p>
<p>There, at the sight of Bhagavant, she recovered her intellect. Bhagavant ordered <span class="corr" id="xd31e4073" title="Source: Ananda">Ānanda</span> to give her an over robe, and he taught her the doctrine, and admitted her into the
ecclesiastical body, and he appointed her the chief of the Bhikshuṇīs who had embraced
discipline.

<p class="first">A merchant who had married in Vārāṇasī determined to go to sea again with merchandise.
His wife refused to stay behind. While they were on the voyage their ship was upset
by a sea-monster. The husband perished, but the wife escaped on a plank, and was driven
by the wind to Kaśerudvīpa, where dwelt the bird-king Suparṇa, who made her his wife.
She bare him first a very beautiful boy, and then a young bird Suparṇa, who, after
his father’s death, was installed king of the birds. His mother insisted on his installing
his elder brother as king in Vārāṇasī, so he carried off King Brahmadatta in his claws,
and flung him into the sea; then he set on the throne in his place his own brother,
arrayed in all splendour, and he warned the ministers that he would treat exactly
like Brahmadatta any one of them who did the least thing wrong. The name of Brahmadatta
was given likewise to the new king, who begged his brother to assist him from time
to time.
</p>
<p>After some time it happened that the king’s elephant, which was parturient, was unable
to bring forth its young. The ministers advised that it should be led into the zenana,
in order that it might be relieved of its pains by <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>the asseverations of the king’s wives. But although the elephant was introduced there,
and the wives pronounced their asseverations, the pains did not come to an end, and
the elephant uttered the most fearful cries. They were heard by a woman who was looking
after some oxen near the palace, and who declared that by means of her asseveration
the pains would be brought to an end. When the ministers had told this to the king,
and he had ordered her to be brought into the zenana, she said, “If it is true that
one husband is sufficient for me, and I have not two husbands, then as the result
of this truth let the elephant be eased of its pains.” Immediately after this utterance
the elephant brought forth. When the king was informed of this, he declared that all
his wives were of vicious habits, and ordered the herdswoman to be summoned. When
she had replied in the affirmative to his question as to whether the elephant had
been relieved of its pains in consequence of her asseveration, the king came to the
conclusion that she must have a daughter like unto herself. This daughter, named Suśroṇī,
he took as his wife; but fearing that, if he left her in the company of the other
women of his court, she would undoubtedly contract bad habits, he begged the bird-king
Suparṇa to convey her every day to Kaśerudvīpa, but to bring her back to him every
night. Suparṇa agreed to this, and sent him every day wreaths of the odorous flower
Timira, which grew at Kaśerudvīpa.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>A Brahman youth who had gone into the forest for fuel was seen there by a Kinnarī,
who hid him away in a rocky grot, where she used to enjoy his company. Whenever he
left the cave, in order to fetch flowers and fruits, she closed its entrance with
a great block of stone, which the Brahman youth was unable to remove. She bore him
a son, who was called Āśuga (Swiftfoot), because he ran everywhere so swiftly.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>As the father was always praising the merits of Vārāṇasī in his son’s presence, the
boy, when he learnt that it was his father’s birthplace, asked him why he did not
make his way thither. The father pointed out that there was a difficulty, the entrance
of the cave being closed by the block of stone. Thereupon the son began to lift masses
of stone, a larger one every day, until he had rendered himself capable of moving
the block of stone. In order that his mother, who was in the habit of fetching fruits
and flowers from the immediate neighbourhood, should be prevented from coming home
too soon, he one day spat out all the fruits as soon as he had put them into his mouth,
and declared that she must look for better fruits further away from the cave, for
that those which had been plucked in its neighbourhood were uneatable. Next day the
mother betook herself to a great distance, and Āśuga called upon his father to escape,
for he had sent his mother far away. Then he pushed the rock on one side, and they
two reached Vārāṇasī.
</p>
<p>When the mother returned and found the cave empty she sat down and wept. Her friends
consoled her, saying that, as her son was a man, he would not be in distress among
men. The mother declared that, to prevent his being in distress while parted from
her, she would give him something by means of which he could prolong his life. So
she besought her friends, so soon as they should set eyes on him, to give him a lute,
in order that he might support himself by means of it. Only he must be careful not
to touch its uppermost string; for doing so would entail on him a great misfortune.
</p>
<p>The Brahman had sent his son Āśuga to a Brahman as his pupil. One day when Āśuga had
gone into the forest with the other young Brahmans to collect firewood he wandered
far away, and was seen by his mother’s friends, who asked him what news he had to
give. When he had complained of hunger and thirst they asked him if he would <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>not go to his mother, for she was weeping and wailing. He said that he could not hold
converse with his mother, for she was so hot-tempered. Thereupon they gave him the
lute, by means of which he would be able to keep himself alive. But they told him
that, in order that no misfortune might arise, he was not to touch its uppermost string.
Āśuga took the lute to where the Brahman youths were. When he had played and sung
to them there, always without touching the top string, they asked him why he did not
touch it. When he had told them the reason, and in spite of that they touched the
top string, they all began to skip and dance. As this dancing made them late, it was
only in the evening that they returned to their Paṇḍit, who asked them why they had
remained out so long. When the youths had told the whole story the Paṇḍit asked the
young Āśuga if he really understood how to play the lute and to sing. When he said
that he did, he was thereupon obliged to play. And when at the instigation of the
Paṇḍit he touched the top string, the Brahman and his wife began to skip and dance;
moreover, the whole house skipped with a crash, and all the pots and crockery were
broken to pieces. The Brahman in a rage seized the youth Āśuga by the neck and turned
him out of the house.
</p>
<p>After that Āśuga got his living by lute-playing and singing. Five hundred merchants
who were putting to sea took him on board with them as a musician. When he was playing
on board ship one day he touched the top string at the request of the merchants, whereupon
the ship began to bound in the air and capsized, whereby the whole of the merchants
lost their lives. But Āśuga, who got hold of a plank, was driven by a storm to Kaśerudvīpa.
</p>
<p>There he took up his abode in a park where there were no other men. And there, having
seen Suśroṇī, he held dalliance with her. In this fashion she was at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>disposal of Āśuga by day and of King Brahmadatta by night. Now Āśuga besought her
to take him with her to Vārāṇasī. She acceded to his request, asked him his name,
and told him her own. Every day after that she carried with her, when mounted upon
Suparṇa, more and more stones, until she had brought their weight to that of a man’s
body. Then she and Āśuga got on Suparṇa’s back together. She told Āśuga to shut his
eyes, saying that if he opened them a misfortune would occur. But when they drew near
to Vārāṇasī, and Āśuga heard the voices and clamour of many people, he thought that
he had reached the journey’s end. So he opened his eyes; whereupon he immediately
became blind. Suśroṇī left him in the park, and betook herself to King Brahmadatta’s
zenana.
</p>
<p>Now when the king had come, and the trees were putting forth their leaves in the thick
forest, and the voices were heard of geese, cranes, peacocks, parrots, mainas, kokilas,
and pheasants, King Brahmadatta, surrounded by his women, betook himself with Suśroṇī
to the park. There the Brahman youth Āśuga, scenting the odour of the Timira flower,
was chanting a song after this fashion—
</p>
<p>“Set in movement by the wind the odour of the Timira is perceptible. This is Kaśerudvīpa,
where Suśroṇī dwells.”
</p>
<p>Hearing these words the king ordered his women to find out who had sung them. After
Āśuga had been discovered and brought before the king, and had been obliged to repeat
his song, the king asked him how far off Kaśerudvīpa was. He replied in a śloka—
</p>
<p>“The waters of the ocean stretch well nigh a hundred yojanas from here to where lies
Kaśerudvīpa, wherein Suśroṇī dwells.”
</p>
<p>The king answered likewise in a śloka—
</p>
<p>“If it be said that thou hast looked in sinful fashion <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>on my dear Suśroṇī, say then what marks her body bears.”
</p>
<p>Āśuga replied in a śloka—
</p>
<p>“On her thigh is the svastika. Her breast is spiral. Over her spread wreaths of Timira
blossoms.”
</p>
<p>When in this way the king had become aware that Suśroṇī had sinned, he was of opinion
that she was not necessary to him, and that he would give her to the blind man. In
his anger he uttered this śloka—
</p>
<p>“Suśroṇī is given to you, arrayed in all splendour. Let her mount on an ass, and get
ye gone swiftly, exiled from this city.”
</p>
<p>Then he ordered Suśroṇī and the blind man to be driven out of the city, riding upon
the same ass.
</p>
<p>After wandering hither and thither they came at sunset to a hill town, and there they
took up their quarters in an empty temple. That same evening there came five hundred
robbers in order to plunder the town. But its inhabitants perceived this, and overcame
the robbers. The robber chief, on whom they failed to lay hands, escaped into that
same temple. The townsmen surrounded it, but the chief closed the door. When the townsmen
asked who was dwelling there, Āśuga replied that some travellers were there. The townspeople
threatened to make an end of him if he did not give up the robber. The robber chief
said to Suśroṇī, “Why should you have to do with a blind man? We will turn him out
and then live together.” She agreed to this. The robber chief flung the blind man
down from the wall, and the townspeople struck off his head.
</p>
<p>Next day Suśroṇī and the robber chief reached the river Karada, and found no boat
in which to cross it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4130src" href="#xd31e4130">2</a> The robber chief bade her lay aside her finery, saying that she must swim across
the river, and he would bring her things after her. She handed over to him all her
<span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>clothes and ornaments, and went naked into the water. When she reached the middle
of the stream, there arose in her mind the fear that he might run off with her things,
and she uttered this śloka—
</p>
<p>“The Karada is full of water. The fair one gave thee all her things. Fear has arisen
within me. Deceive me not, O evil-doer!”
</p>
<p>He likewise replied in a śloka—
</p>
<p>“For the sake of one unknown hast thou slain one known of old, considering the man
useless. Therefore is it difficult to put trust in thee. Me also mightest thou kill.”
</p>
<p>He went off with her things, but she crawled naked into the thick grass. There came
by an old jackal carrying a piece of flesh.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4142src" href="#xd31e4142">3</a> Just at that spot a fish, driven on to the shore from the stream of the river Karada,
was lying on the dry land. The jackal dropped the piece of flesh and made a dash at
the fish. But the fish sprang back again into the stream, and the flesh was carried
off by a vulture, so that the jackal, deprived of both, was left standing there mournfully,
with drooping ears. Seeing that, Suśroṇī uttered the following śloka—
</p>
<p>“The vulture has carried off the piece of flesh, the fish has slipped into the water.
Wherefore grieves not the jackal, of both those things bereft?”
</p>
<p>The jackal looked around on every side, and, seeing no one, uttered the following
śloka—
</p>
<p>“She who dances not before the robber, who herself has no joy in song, who now abides
in the grass, who is she, who chides and scoffs at me?”
</p>
<p>She replied, “I am Suśroṇī, uncle.” The jackal reflected with vexation that this yoginī
was mocking him, and said—
</p>
<p>“Thy husband hast thou killed. Thy paramour has <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>fled. Wherefore grievest thou not, yoginī, that thou art bereft of both?”
</p>
<p>Suśroṇī replied, “When I have returned home I will take unto me an excellent husband.
When I have obtained a husband, I shall not dishonour the house.”
</p>
<p>The jackal answered, “When the Ganges flows upwards, when the raven has the colour
of curdled milk, then shalt thou be virtuous. When the snake and the ichneumon dwell
in the same hole, and put up with each other, then shalt thou be virtuous. When a
man, making clothes out of the hair of a tortoise, shall be able to provide himself
thereby with a winter garment, then shalt thou be virtuous. When one shall have made
a ladder out of the feet of flies, and climbed up it into heaven, then shalt thou
be virtuous. When a bridge shall have been made out of the stalk of the jessamine,
and an elephant shall have walked across it, then shalt thou be virtuous. When fire
shall burst forth in the middle of the sea, and men shall enter therein, then shalt
thou be virtuous. O Suśroṇī! now that I have scoffed at thee enough, I ask thee what
reward wilt thou give me if I restore thee to thy former position?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4164src" href="#xd31e4164">4</a>
</p>
<p>She replied, “Uncle, if thou wilt do that, I will give thee a piece of meat every
day.”
</p>
<p>“I will do it, see if I do not. Go into the water, immerse thyself in it up to thy
neck, and remain there with thy face turned towards the east. I will go and petition
the king.”
</p>
<p>So the jackal drew near to the royal palace, and made his request to the king, saying
that it would be meet and fitting to send for Suśroṇī at once, seeing that she was
piously and righteously performing penance. King Brahmadatta understood the language
of the jackal, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>he ordered his ministers to send for Suśroṇī at once. The ministers made their appearance
with clothes and ornaments, and the king restored her to her former position. Every
day she gave the jackal a piece of meat. This she did for some long time. But at length
she gave up doing so. Then the jackal came close to the royal palace, and threatened
that if she failed to bring the gift, it would lay hold of her, and set her back again
in the place she occupied before. She was alarmed, and continued to give it a piece
of meat every day.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Buddha Bhagavant was abiding in Rājagṛiha in Veṇuvana in Kalandakanivāsa. In Rājagṛiha
lived the two Nāgarājas Girika and Sundara, through whose influence the five hundred
warm springs in Rājagṛiha, the rivers, lakes, and pools received from the deity, from
time to time, a rich copiousness of waters, whereby the grain thrived in the most
excellent manner. As Bhagavant had brought under his influence the two Nāgarājas,
Nanda and Upananda, they used to come to the slopes of Sumeru and manifest their respect
to Bhagavant on the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth days of the month. Thereupon
the two Nāgarājas, Girika and Sundara, considered that, as the two Nāgarājas, Nanda
and Upananda<span class="corr" id="xd31e4190" title="Source: .">,</span> visited the Sumeru slopes on the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth of the month in
order to show their respect for Bhagavant, they themselves who dwelt on the spot ought
to testify their respect for Bhagavant. So they went to Bhagavant, paid honour with
their heads to his feet, and seated themselves on the ground. Then Bhagavant confirmed
them in refuge-seeking and in the basis of doctrine, whereby they felt themselves
very much elevated. Thereupon they formed the intention of betaking themselves to
the ocean. So they went to Bhagavant, paid him honour, and spoke to him thus: “O worthy
of reverence, inasmuch as Bhagavant has led us to the search after refuge and the
principles of the doctrine, we have become <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>so elevated that we would fain, if Bhagavant allows us, betake ourselves to the ocean.”
Bhagavant replied, “O Nāgarājas, as ye dwell in the land of Bimbisāra, king of Magadha,
ye must ask him.” They considered that there must be some reason why Bhagavant did
not allow them to betake themselves to the ocean. When they appeared at night before
Bhagavant in order to show him honour, they formed part of the retinue of the Gods’<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4195src" href="#xd31e4195">2</a> dwelling. But when they came by day they had the appearance of ordinary householders.
</p>
<p>At that time Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, went to Veṇuvana to Kalandakanivāsa. With
Kshatriya pride the king halted on the way, and said to a man of low degree, “Ho,
man, go and see who is paying honour to Bhagavant.” The man of low degree obeyed the
command of the king, went to the spot where Bhagavant was, and saw that there were
two householders who were paying honour to Bhagavant. Of this he informed the king,
remarking that those men dwelt no doubt in his territory. The king imagined that those
two householders, as they dwelt in his territory, would be sure to rise up when he
appeared, and he went to the place where Bhagavant was. The two Nāgarājas perceived
him from afar, and said to Bhagavant, “O worthy of reverence, what ought to be done?
Should we now pay honour to the excellent law or to the king?”
</p>
<p>“O Nāgarājas, do ye pay honour to the excellent law. The Buddha-Bhagavants pay honour
to the excellent law, and the Arhants also honour the law highly.” This saying he
repeated also in verse.
</p>
<p>Then the two Nāgarājas omitted to rise in presence of the king, and the king waxed
angry at seeing that the two householders who dwelt in his land did not stand up.
After he had paid honour with his head to Bhagavant’s feet, he sat down upon the ground
and besought Bhagavant to instruct him in the doctrine. Bhagavant uttered the following
verses:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Not by him who is beside himself, who is excited by passion, can the excellent doctrine
taught by the perfected Buddha be comprehended. But he who represses the commencement
of sins, who lays aside anger, and who has given up passion, he can comprehend the
excellent words.”
</p>
<p>The king thought that Bhagavant took the side of the two householders, and therefore
would not teach him the doctrine; so he went away thence. When he had departed from
Veṇuvana, he said to his servants, “So soon as those two householders go away from
Bhagavant, tell them in the name of the king that they must not remain in the country.”
Having received this order from the king, the servants remained there, and communicated
the king’s order to the two Nāgarājas when they made their appearance. The two Nāgarājas
perceived that their long fostered wish was going to be fulfilled. So they produced
on the spot a mighty jet of water, and betook themselves into small canals, and from
the small canals into great canals, and from the great canals into small rivers, and
from the small rivers into great rivers, and from the great rivers into the ocean.
When they two reached the ocean, they were far more elevated than before.
</p>
<p>At that same time the five hundred warm springs in Rājagṛiha, the rivers, lakes, and
pools, inasmuch as the deity no longer sent them from time to time a fulness of water,
began to dry up, and the crops began to perish. Then the king reflected that by the
power of the Nāgarājas the water-courses used to be kept constantly full, and, as
this was no longer the case, he considered that those two Nāgarājas were perhaps dead,
or had been carried off or shut up by a snake charmer. He determined then to obtain
information on this point from the omniscient Bhagavant. Bhagavant replied that the
two Nāgarājas had not been destroyed, nor had they died, and that they had not <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>taken themselves away secretly, nor had they been imprisoned by a snake charmer, but
that they had been banished from the country by the king himself.
</p>
<p>“Venerable sir, so far as I can remember, I have never seen, much less exiled, the
two Nāgarājas Girika and Sundara.”
</p>
<p>“O great king, I will recall the fact to your memory.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon Bhagavant informed him that those two householders whom he had sent out
of the country were precisely those two Nāgarājas, and recommended him, in order to
obtain help for his land, to ask for their forgiveness. The king observed that he
was not in a position to do this, as they had departed into the ocean. Then Bhagavant
informed him that they were accustomed to come, in order to show him honour, on the
eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth days of the month. And that when he was teaching
them the doctrine, the king might ask their forgiveness.
</p>
<p>“Venerable sir, how should that be done? Ought I to touch the feet of them twain!”
</p>
<p>“No, great king, that is what men of inferior degree do, who touch the hand of their
superiors. But you should stretch out your right hand, and say to the two Nāgarājas:
‘Forgive me!’ ”
</p>
<p>So when the king met the two Nāgarājas in the presence of Bhagavant, he followed his
instructions, and received the pardon he asked for.
</p>
<p>Then he said: “O Nāgarājas, having accorded me forgiveness, return back to my country.”
They replied that they would do so then only when he had erected two temples, the
one for Girika and the other for Sundara, and had provided them with the necessary
attendants, and had founded a festival to be held every six months, at which they
would appear in person and accept hospitality. The king obeyed these orders. He built
the two temples, the one for Girika, and the other <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>for Sundara, and he founded a festival to be held every six months. When this festival
took place, vast multitudes of men came together from the six great cities.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>One day there came an actor from the south, with the intention of discovering something
whereby he might amuse the company, and obtain a large reward for himself. He hoped
to attain both ends if he glorified the most excellent of men. Inasmuch then as the
multitudes were full of faith in Bhagavant, he wished to take him as the subject of
glorification, so he betook himself to Nanda and said:
</p>
<p>“Venerable sir, when Bhagavant dwelling as the Bodisat in the Tushita region had arranged
the five considerations respecting caste, race, country, time and wife, and had let
the six Kāmāvachara gods three times perform the rites of purification, and in the
form of an elephant had consciously entered the mother’s womb, at that time the great
earth quaked violently, and those regions of the world which enjoy the light neither
of the sun nor of the moon, and therefore are filled with utter darkness, were illumined
with the greatest brilliance; so that when the beings, which otherwise could not see
their own hands when they stretched them out, saw each other by means of this light,
they cried: <span class="corr" id="xd31e4225" title="Source: “">‘</span>Honoured sirs, there are other beings besides ourselves born here.<span class="corr" id="xd31e4228" title="Source: ”">’</span> When after the lapse of ten months Bhagavant the Bodisat was born, leaving the mother’s
womb, then likewise did the great earth quake, and the bright radiance ensued. On
the day on which Bhagavant the Bodisat was born, on that same day were born also sons
of four great kings. In Śrāvastī truly to King Aranemi Brahmadatta there was born
a son whom he called Prasenajit, because the whole world was filled with radiance
at his birth. In Rājagṛiha there was born to King Mahāpadma a son whom he called Bimbisāra,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>because he was the son of Queen Bimbī, and at his birth the world was illumined as
at the rise of the sun’s disk. In Kauśāmbī there was born to King Śatānīka a son whom
he named Udajana, because the world was illumined at his birth as if by the rising
of the sun. In Videha there was born to King Anantanemi a son, whom he called Pradyota,
because at his birth the world was greatly illumined. On the day on which Bhagavant
the Bodisat was born, there were born also five hundred Śākya sons, Bhadrika, and
so forth, and five hundred attendants, Chhanda, and so forth. Five hundred mares gave
birth to five hundred colts, Kanthaka, and so forth, and five hundred treasures were
conferred by the gods. The Brahmans versed in omens prophesied with respect to Bhagavant
the Bodisat as follows: <span class="corr" id="xd31e4233" title="Source: “">‘</span>If the Prince remains in the palace, he will become a Chakravartin, who will conquer
the four regions of the world, a ruler in accordance with the law, a king having the
seven treasures, those of the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the gem, the wife, the
householder, and the general, a king to whom there shall be born a full thousand of
heroic, extremely handsome sons, victorious over hosts of foes, and under whom the
whole great earth up to the ocean shall live in peace of mind and in harmony with
the law, free from harm or danger, without punishments or force of arms. But if, full
of faith, with shorn hair and beard, and dressed in dark brown raiment, he leaves
his home and joins the ecclesiastical body, then will he gain the renown in the world
of a Tathāgata, an Arhant, and a fully consummated Buddha.<span class="corr" id="xd31e4236" title="Not in source">’</span>”
</p>
<p>At the time when Bhagavant the Bodisat was born, it was known everywhere that on the
shore of the river Bhagirathī, on the side of Himavant, not very far from the hermitage
of the Rishi Kapila, a Śākya prince was born, and what sort of prophesies the Brahmans
skilled in omens had uttered. When the kings of the earth <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>heard thereof, they reflected that if they exalted the prince, they would gain thereby,
and that if they honoured King Suddhodana, the prince would thereby be honoured; so
they began to pay honour to King Suddhodana, and to send him in due season envoys
and caskets of jewels. As King Suddhodana reflected that all things had attained their
ends in consequence of the birth of his son, that son ought to receive the name of
Sarvārthasiddha, and he called him by that name accordingly. When the prince had been
taken to pay reverence to the Śākya-god, the Yaksha Śākyavardha, but was received
with reverence by him, the Śākya-Mighty-One, he received the names of Śākyamuni and
God of gods (Devātideva).
</p>
<p>When Bhagavant the Bodisat had attained perfection in all sciences, and had enjoyed
himself in youth, but then had looked upon old age, sickness, and death, and his mind
had been agitated thereby, he retired into the forest and devoted himself for six
years to penance. At that time were two hundred and fifty men sent every day, who
made known the words of King Suddhodana and of Suprabuddha, and daily carried the
words spoken by Bhagavant the Bodisat.
</p>
<p>When Bhagavant the Bodisat had practised penance for the space of six years, and had
attained to the knowledge that it was all of no avail, he desired to restore himself
completely. So he took rice soup, and warm food in abundance, anointed his body with
oil and melted butter, and bathed it with warm water. And when he came to the village
of Senānī, the village maidens Nandā and Nandabalā gave him sixteen times purified
milk mixed with honey, and the Nāgarāja Kālika extolled him. From the Svastika grass-dealers
he received gold coloured grass. When he arrived at Bodhimaṇḍa, after he had prepared
himself a couch of indestructible grass, and had taken up his seat upon it with crossed
legs, and had made straight his body, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>strengthened his memory, he said with emotion, “Until I shall have attained sinlessness
will I not change my sitting position. How then Bhagavant the Bodisat, after he had,
at the midnight hour by means of the wheel of mildness overcome Māra and the host
of three hundred and sixty millions of demons, attained to the supreme perfection
of insight—all this he pleased to relate to me in full.”
</p>
<p>Nanda asked, “What do you want it for?” The actor replied, “Venerable sir, I wish
to compose a drama.” Nanda said, “Wretched man, do you wish us to portray the Teacher
for you? Begone, for I will tell you nothing.” Then the actor betook himself to Upananda,
but received from him the same answer, and the result was the same when he had recourse
to <span class="corr" id="xd31e4249" title="Source: Aśuga">Āśuga</span>, Ravata, Chhanda, and Udayin. Thereupon the actor betook himself to where the company
of Twelve Bhikshuṇīs was. First of all he had recourse to Sthūlanandā. When she had
inquired what he wanted the information for, and he had replied that it was for a
drama, she asked whether he would give her a recompense for her trouble. He promised
that he would. Then as Sthūlanandā was very learned, and knew the Tripiṭaka thoroughly,
she related everything to him in full out of the Abhinishkramaṇa-Sūtra, how Bhagavant
the Bodisat, while dwelling in the Tushita region, appointed the five meditations
with respect to caste, race, country, time, and wife, and having appointed these considerations,
and having allowed the six Kāmāvachara gods to receive purification three times, he
consciously entered the mother’s womb, transformed into the shape of an elephant.
Whereupon the great earth quaked greatly, and the intervals of the world in which
the sun and moon are looked upon as great wonders, and the darkness is exceedingly
great, inasmuch as no light is enjoyed there, were profusely illumined anew, so that
<span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>the beings born therein, which had not been able to see their own hands when they
stretched them out, looking upon one another by means of this light, exclaimed, “Honoured
sirs, other beings also have been born here.” Then she related to him all that had
taken place up to the time, when at midnight Bhagavant the Bodisat overcame Māra and
the attending three hundred and sixty millions of demons by the force of mildness,
and attained to supreme insight.
</p>
<p>The actor then composed his drama, and, as he knew that by means of it he could exalt
the faith still higher, amid the masses of believers, he considered how he might create
faith also among unbelievers. And, as he bore a grudge against the Six Bhikshus, and
desired to find a cause of reproach against them, he betook himself to them. Now Āyushmant
Chhanda had just prepared some food, but let it stand over. With the hope, however
of partaking of sweet food, in case he met with any, he had washed his hands. With
such food Āyushmant Udayin had supplied himself, so Chhanda sat down before him with
crossed legs and begged him to think of him, saying, “I, the Bhikshu Chhanda, had
prepared food, but I let it stand over, as I was fully satisfied. But now that I have
found food, I desire to eat, and I beg you to leave me something,” After taking two
or three morsels of the food, Udayin said, “Take and go.”
</p>
<p>When the actor heard that, he thought that he might thereby convert even unbelievers
to the faith. So he pitched a booth in <span class="corr" id="xd31e4258" title="Source: Rajagṛiha">Rāajagṛiha</span> on the day when the festival of the Nāgarājas Girika and Sundara was celebrated,
and sounded a drum. And when a great crowd had collected, he exhibited in a drama
the above-mentioned events in the life of Bhagavant, in harmony with the Abhinishkramaṇasūtra.
Thereby the performers and the assembled crowds were confirmed in the faith. And they
uttered sounds of approval, and he made a large profit.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>In order that among the unbelievers also he might excite faith, he introduced one
actor under the guise of Udayin, and another under that of Chhanda. And he filled
a dish with ashes, on the top of which he placed two or three lumps of sugar. In front
of him who played the part of Udayin, the other sat down cross-legged, and said, “Venerable
Udayin, remember me. I am the Bhikshu Chhanda, and I have let my food stand over,
for I was quite satisfied. But now that I have met with food, I want to eat, and I
beg you will leave me something.” Then he who played the part of Udayin ate up the
two or three lumps of sugar, and upset the ashes which were in the dish over the head
of him who played the part of Chhanda, and said, “Take and go.” The crowd burst out
laughing loudly, and even the unbelieving became believing, saying that it was a mad
prank. And the actor made a large profit.
</p>
<p>Now when men’s talk had made the Six Bhikshus aware that the actor had taken them
off they resolved to take counsel with the Bhikshuṇīs and make things unpleasant for
him. So they betook themselves to the company of Twelve and asked them if they still
retained any recollection of the play composed by them on the life of the Bodisat
named Kuru. When they had gone out together into the park, and it was found that they
had not forgotten even the least part of it, they supplied themselves with ornaments
and raiment from the palace, and they set up a booth close to that of the actor. Then
Upananda covered up his head with a cloth and beat the drum. A great crowd assembled,
and in it was the actor, who thought that he was witnessing a divine drama, and was
of opinion that it was performed by Gods, Nāgas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras, or
Mahoragas.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4265src" href="#xd31e4265">3</a> So great was his astonishment.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the Six went away, after finishing the performance and changing their clothes,
the actor followed after them, in order to find out who they were, waiting for them
at the door as they went out. When Udayin came forth, whose ears seemed to be smeared
as though with orpiment, the actor asked him if he had been performing in the play.
Udayin replied that they had wished to do him a hurt in that way, saying, “You wretch,
who live by our art! as you have brought us on to the stage, we will go to every place
where you perform, and we will annoy you. We have no need to provide ourselves with
drums and strange properties.”
</p>
<p>The actor begged for pardon, for he got his living by his performances. Udayin demanded
in return for this that the actor should give up to him the whole of his receipts.
To which demand the actor yielded, from fear of farther interference.

<h2 class="main"><i>THE DUMB CRIPPLE.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4279src" href="#xd31e4279">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long past days, King Brahmadatta lived in the city of Vārāṇasī. His wife’s name
was Brahmavatī, and a lake also bore the same name. Now the king was childless, and
longed to have a son. With that intent he implored the gods in all manner of ways.
At length his entreaties were heard, and a being of firm resolve, departing from hell,
entered into the queen’s womb. At her desire the king ordered presents to be given
at all the gates of the city. Later on he had to go with her into the penance forest,
and in the third place to embark with her on board a ship, which was constructed at
her request, and placed in the above-named lake. There she gave birth to a fine boy,
who was endowed with recollection of his previous existence. As he was born on the
water, the name of Abja (water-born) was given to him.
</p>
<p>As he rapidly grew up under the care of nurses and female attendants, he reflected
that, if he were to be invested with sovereign power, this would not be a good thing,
seeing that in consequence of a sixty years reign which he had accomplished in a previous
state of existence, he had been born again in hell, and that he now ran the risk of
going to hell a second time. So he determined to evade the sovereignty by means of
an artifice, and he pretended to be a cripple. As the five hundred ministers’ sons
who were his playfellows, having all been <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>born at the same time with him, were in the habit of running and jumping, King Brahmadatta
reflected that his son, if he were not a cripple, would take part in those exercises.
However, he determined to invest him with the sovereign power, although he was a cripple.
When Prince Abja heard of this, he thought that it was very unkind of his father to
do him such an injury, and he determined to pretend he was dumb. So he was commonly
called “The Dumb Cripple.”
</p>
<p>When his father heard the five hundred sons of ministers speak, while his son remained
dumb, he became exceedingly sad. When the ministers remarked this sadness of his,
he explained to them that it was his son’s dumbness which was troubling him. The ministers
consulted the doctor, who declared that the prince was in perfect health, and was
troubled by no complaint, and that he must be acted upon by threats. So King Brahmadatta
sent for the executioners, and let them know privately that he was going to hand over
the prince to them in the presence of a great assemblage, but that they were not to
put him to death. In obedience to the king’s commands, the executioners put the prince
in a cart, and took him out of the city. When the prince saw the extent and the wealth
of Vārāṇasī, he asked: “Is this city of Vārāṇasī deserted or inhabited?” The executioners
took the prince back to his father, to whom they reported the words he had uttered.
King Brahmadatta threw his arms around his son and said to him: “O youth, whom ought
one to kill? Whom ought one to order to be killed? From whom ought life to be taken?
To whom ought a gift to be granted, and what sort of a gift?” To these questions his
son made no reply, but remained dumb. Then King Brahmadatta spake again to the executioners,
saying, “I deliver unto you this prince, do ye carry him away.” The executioners again,
in obedience to the king’s commands, set the prince <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>in a cart and conveyed him out of the city. The prince saw four men carrying a corpse,
and said, “Is this corpse that of a dead man or of a living man?” Again did the executioners
take the prince back to his father, and repeat the words which he had uttered. King
Brahmadatta folded his son in his arms, and put the same questions to him as before.
But again did the son make no reply, persisting in his silence. The king then renewed
his orders to the executioners to carry away the prince. When they had set him in
a cart and conveyed him out of the city, the prince espied a great heap of grain,
and said, “If this heap of grain were not continually devoured at its base, it would
become great.” Again did the executioners take the prince back to the king, and report
the words which he had spoken. The king once more repeated the questions he had asked
before, but his son left them unanswered. Then said King Brahmadatta to the executioners,
“I deliver unto you the prince, go, bury him in a hole in the forest.” In obedience
to the king’s commands, the executioners set the prince on a cart, took him into the
forest, and there set to work to dig a hole. Then spake the prince the following śloka:
</p>
<p>“Wherefore, O waggon-driver, dost thou deliberately dig a hole? Wherefore do ye dig
a hole? Answer the question quickly.”
</p>
<p>The waggon-driver replied, “Because the king’s son, dumb and a cripple from birth,
does not speak, therefore will he soon, according to our commands, be put into the
hole in the forest.”
</p>
<p>Then was the prince horrified at the thought that the cruel, red-handed, life-destroying
executioners, men familiar with blows and deathstrokes, producers of fear by executions,
should now proceed to kill him also, and he said, “If the king will grant me the fulfilment
of one wish, I will go to the city on foot, and moreover I will speak.” The executioners
went to the king and told him <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>all that had occurred. The king said, “If the prince wishes for the sovereignty, that
also will I yield to him.” Joyfully did he give orders to the ministers to clear the
city with all speed of stones, and to provide incense, perfumes, flags, standards,
and flowers of all kinds. The ministers carried out the king’s commands, and many
hundreds of thousands of people crowded together in order to witness the entry of
the prince, and to hear him speak. The prince entered the city on foot, and when he
came to where the king was, he showed him reverence, and said in ślokas—
</p>
<p>“I am neither dumb nor crippled, I am neither dull nor senseless. With clear words
am I able to speak, O prince of men. I am neither dumb nor crippled, I am neither
dull nor senseless. Sound and clear and bright is my mind, O prince of men!”
</p>
<p>When the king asked him why he had not spoken before, and why he had not used his
legs, he replied—
</p>
<p>“Hearken unto me, O king! In a former life I reigned as a king for sixty years, and
then for sixty thousand years I suffered incessant tortures in hell. Remembering those
terrible pangs, I do not wish to reign again, and therefore I beseech you, O my father,
to allow me to renounce the world.”
</p>
<p>The father replied, “But, my son, it is for the sake of supremacy that the Rishis
undertake penance and offer sacrifice. Wherefore will you, my son, give up that which
is in your hands, and renounce the world?”
</p>
<p>The prince replied that he did not wish to live in enjoyment, which is provocative
of discord and contest, and that he preferred a life of penance; the former resembled
the Kimpāka fruit, the latter possessed the Amṛita flavour. The king observed that
the royal power guaranteed the enjoyment of all good things, and asked why he wished
to give up the throne, and take to the ascetic life. The son replied that we ought
to consider <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>that as true pleasure from which pain ensues, and should in like manner esteem that
as pain from which pleasure ensues, and that his father ought to allow him to go into
the forest of penance. The king represented to him all the comforts of life in the
palace, with incense, and odorous powders and flowers, with repose, free from all
perils, on a soft couch, with awaking to the sound of music, with soft clothing, and
savoury food and drink. On the other hand, he brought before his eyes the life of
penance in the forest, the resting on leaves spread under a tree, amid all sorts of
dangers, among wild gazelles, the awaking to the sound of the jackal’s howl, the raiment
of bark, the nourishment composed of roots and fruits, and the tepid, turbid water.
The son replied that it would be better to live in the forest with raiment of bark,
and roots and fruits for food, and wild gazelles as companions, that the wise prefer
all this to a sovereignty, the characteristics of which are killing, binding, and
smiting, and which is accompanied by danger with respect to the life to come; and
that his father ought therefore to allow him to go into the forest of penance. The
king said, “O son! answer these three questions of mine. Then you may renounce the
world. When you saw the wealth and the extent of Vārāṇasī, you asked, ‘Is Vārāṇasī
deserted, or is the city inhabited?’ For what reason did you say this?”
</p>
<p>“Hear, O king, wherefore I said that. It was because, when you had condemned me to
death without any cause, no one ventured to put the direct question as to how that
came about.”
</p>
<p>“O son, you were right. But when you saw a corpse being carried along, you asked whether
it was the body of a living or a dead person. For what reason did you ask that?”
</p>
<p>“Hear, O king, the reason why. I said that because the corpse of him who has committed
a crime is the corpse <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>of one who is dead. But the corpse of him who has accomplished a good action is the
corpse of one who is alive.”
</p>
<p>“O son, you were right. But when you saw the heap of grain you said, ‘If this heap
of grain were not continually consumed at its base, it would wax great.’ Wherefore
did you then say that?”
</p>
<p>“Hear, O king, the reason why. I said that because the tillers of the soil, after
they have borrowed corn, and have used it, are obliged to give a large heap of corn
to the faithful after the labours of the field, so soon as the corn is ripe, and therefore
do they consume it at its base. In like manner, when man has reached the path of the
ten works of virtue, but continues on it no further, the roots of his earlier virtue
are severed, and when they are severed, he passes from the path of bliss into perdition.
For that reason have I thus spoken.”
</p>
<p>When the king heard these words of his son he embraced him with tearful eyes, and
not only bade him behave according to his wish, but also allowed him to take all his
young companions with him into the forest. There he who had hitherto been called the
Dumb Cripple received the name of the Dumb Teacher. On the death of the Rishi under
whom he had taken the vows he succeeded to his privileges, and he was able to manage
so that his disciples, who had too great a quantity of mats, clothes, and utensils,
at last followed his example, and contented themselves with that only which was most
necessary.

<p class="first">In very remote times, in a forest region free from villages and richly provided with
flowers, fruits, water, and roots, there lived a penance-performing Rishi, who fed
upon roots, fruit, and water, and clothed himself with leaves and skins. As he had
attained the five kinds of insight, the wild gazelles themselves were wont to dwell
in the hermitage keeping him company. One day a gazelle doe came to a spot where he
had lately been. And as the results of human actions are beyond mental comprehension
it came to pass that she became pregnant. When the time came for her to bring forth,
she went to that place and there gave birth to a boy. When she had smelt it, and perceived
that it was a creature that did not resemble herself, she was terrified, and deserted
it. When the Rishi came to that place and saw the child, he began to consider whose
child it could be, and perceived that it was his own child. So he took it with him
into his hermitage and there brought it up. When the boy had grown up, gazelle horns
appeared on his head, on which account the Rishi gave him the name of Ṛshyaśringa
(Gazelle-horn).
</p>
<p>The Rishi fell ill, and was treated with fitting remedies, but the illness would not
abate. When he saw that he must die, he spake shortly before his decease to the boy
as follows:—
</p>
<p>“O son, as from time to time many Rishis come to this <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>hermitage from all manner of regions, you must from love to me welcome them with the
customary greeting, receive them in a friendly manner, invite them to repose on the
couch, and set before them roots and fruits according to your means.”
</p>
<p>Then, according as it is said that the end of collection is diffusion, the end of
the high is to fall, the end of coming together is separation, and the end of life
is death, so he discharged his obligations to this law. The youth burnt the Rishi’s
corpse in the usual manner, and then, as he mourned, being depressed by grief at the
loss of his father, he became possessed of the five kinds of insight.
</p>
<p>One day, when he had gone to fetch water in a pitcher, the deity began to let rain
fall. As he walked along with the pitcher, which was quite full of water, he let it
fall, so that it broke. Rishis are very quickly moved to wrath. So spilling the little
water there was left, he reproached the deity, saying, “As my full water pitcher has
been broken in consequence of your bad behaviour, you shall not let rain fall for
twelve years from this day.” On account of this curse the deity let no rain fall.
A great famine consequently arose in Vārāṇasī, and its inhabitants emigrated in all
directions. The king sent for the diviners and said to them, “Honoured sirs, to whose
power is it due that the deity sends no rain?” They replied, “To a Rishi’s anger.
If he can be disturbed in his penances the deity will again send rain. Otherwise it
is not possible.” The king sat absorbed in thought. His wives, the princes, and the
ministers asked him, “Wherefore, O king, are you displeased?” He replied, “On account
of a Rishi’s anger the deity sends no rain. The diviners have declared that if the
Rishi can be disturbed in his penances the deity will send rain again, but that otherwise
it is impossible.”
</p>
<p>One of the king’s daughters, Śāntā by name, said, “O king, if that be the case, be
not disturbed. I will contrive so that the Rishi shall be completely distracted from
this <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>penance.” The king said, “By what means?” She replied, “Let me and other women be
taught mystic lore by the Brahmans. And let a hermitage, provided with flowers, fruits,
and water, be prepared on a ferry-boat.” The king allowed her and other women to be
taught mystic lore by the Brahmans, and a hermitage to be constructed on a ferry-boat.
Then she gave orders for the preparation of tempting objects, and fruits filled with
wine, and other very bright fruits of various kinds. And she made herself look like
a Rishi, dressed herself in bark and grass, and betook herself to that Rishi’s hermitage,
attended by the women to whom the Brahmans had taught mystic lore. His pupils said
to the Rishi, “O teacher, many Rishis have come to the hermitage.” He replied, “It
is well that Rishis should have come; bring them in.” When they had come in and he
had looked at them, he said in verse, “Alas! a Rishi’s appearance was never like this
of old—a loosely flowing step, a face free from beard, a rising and falling breast.”
His mind a prey to doubt, he offered his visitors roots and fruit. They partook of
them, and said to the Rishi, “Your fruits are harsh and acid. The fruits which are
to be found in our hermitage on the water are Amṛita-like. Therefore do we invite
you to our hermitage.”
</p>
<p>He accepted their invitation and went with them to the pleasure-ground on board the
ferry-boat. There they spread before him stupefying substances, cocoa-nuts filled
with wine, and other fruits. When he had become intoxicated with wine, and seduced
by the alluring substances, he gave himself up to pleasure with the women, and his
magic power vanished. The deity rejoicing in rain called the clouds together from
every side and got the better of the Rishi. Śāntā said, “Now, do you know what the
power is?” Having fettered the Rishi with amorous bonds she brought him to the king
and said, “O king, this is the man.”
</p>
<p>As the deity now began to send rain a good harvest <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>ensued. The king gave Śāntā to the Rishi as his wife, together with her attendants.
But when the Rishi, deserting her, began to indulge in love with other women, she
also began to treat him with small respect, her good humour being destroyed by jealousy.
One day, when during a wrangle with him, she hit him a blow on the head with a shoe,
he said to himself—
</p>
<p>“I, who used not to allow power to the thunder of the cloud, must now, being fettered
by love bonds, allow myself to be set at nought by a woman!”
</p>
<p>Thereupon he again devoted himself to ascetic exertion, and once more became possessed
of the five kinds of insight.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long past times King Viśvāmitra reigned in the city of Viśvanāgara. As a king of
the law, according to the law he ruled over that city, which was blest with wealth,
plenty, prosperity, fruitfulness, and a large population, richly provided with rice,
sugar-cane, oxen, and buffaloes, and free from disease, discord, quarrels, uproar,
strife, and robbery. The king’s faith was pure and his mind virtuous, he bethought
himself of his own welfare and that of others, he was full of compassion, constant
in magnanimity, and kindly towards mankind.
</p>
<p>It came to pass that his wife conceived, and, after a space of eight or nine months,
gave birth to a fine, well-formed, handsome boy, whose complexion was the colour of
gold, his head canopy-like, his arms long, his forehead high-arched, his eyebrows
interlacing, his nose aquiline, all his limbs and joints complete. When his birthday
feast was celebrated after his birth, his kinsmen proceeded to give him a name. They
said, “As the boy is King Viśvāmitra’s son he shall be called Viśvaṇtara.<span class="corr" id="xd31e4363" title="Not in source">”</span> To the boy Viśvaṇtara were given eight nurses, two for carrying, two for suckling,
two for cleansing, and two for playing, who fed him on milk, curdled milk, butter,
melted butter, butter-foam, and divers other excellent kinds of nutriment, so that
he grew rapidly like a lotus in a pool. When he <span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>had grown up and learnt writing, counting, and hand-reckoning, he applied himself
to all the arts and accomplishments which befit one of the Kshatriya class who has
been consecrated to be a king, a ruler provided with riches, might, and heroism, a
subduer of the whole orb. Such are riding on elephants and horses, driving in a car,
handling of a sword and bow, advancing and retreating, flinging an iron hook, slinging,
shooting missiles, striking, cutting, stabbing, seizing, marching, and the five methods
of shooting. The young Viśvaṇtara, in whom dwelt pure faith and virtuous feelings,
was considerate as to his own welfare and that of others, compassionate and addicted
to magnanimity, kindly towards men, of a yielding and generous nature, bestowing presents
freely and quite dispassionately, and assiduous in giving away. When men heard of
this excessive generosity on his part, numberless crowds came to beg of him, whom
he sent away with their expectations completely fulfilled.
</p>
<p>One day the Bodisat Viśvaṇtara drove out of the excellent city to the park, in a splendid
chariot, gleaming with jewels, gold, silver, steel, coral, lapis-lazuli, turquoises,
rubies, and sapphires, constructed of sandalwood, covered with skins of lions, tigers,
and bears, its four horses rushing along with the swiftness of the wind, resonant
with bells of gold and silver. Some Brahmans versed in the Vedas met him and said,
“O Kshatriya youth, may you be victorious!” And they added thereto, “Through the whole
world are you renowned as one who gives all things away. Therefore it is meet that
you should confer this chariot as a gift on the Brahmans.” When they had thus spoken,
the Bodisat Viśvaṇtara swiftly alighted from the chariot, and, while with joyful heart
he gave the chariot to the Brahmans, he said, “As I have given away the chariot with
the greatest pleasure, so may I, giving away the three worlds, become possessed of
the greatest insight!”
</p>
<p>Another time he was riding on the elephant Rājyavardhana,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4370src" href="#xd31e4370">2</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>which in whiteness equalled jasmine blossoms, white lotuses, snow, silver, and the
clouds, which was of a remarkable size and provided with well-formed feet and trunk,
and which strode along like the elephant Airāvaṇa, marked with the signs of distinguished
gifts, and remarkable for its capacity. On it, followed by the troop of very devoted
slaves, friends, and servants, like unto the moon surrounded by the starry host, he
rode, as the spring was come, to the forest park, wherein the trees and the flowers
were blooming, and the flamingoes, cranes, peacocks, parrots, mainas, cuckoos, and
pheasants, were calling. There came up hastily unto Prince Viśvaṇtara, certain Brahmans
who were engaged in discussion, and said to him, “Kshatriya prince, may you be victorious!”
And they added thereto, “In the world with beings divine and not divine you are renowned
as an All-giver. Therefore it is meet that you should give us this splendid elephant.”
When they had said this, the Bodisat swiftly alighted from the splendid elephant,
and having presented that most splendid elephant to them with the utmost good humour,
he said, “As I have given the elephant to the Brahmans with the greatest pleasure,
so may I, after I have given away the three worlds, become possessed of perfect insight!”
</p>
<p>When it became known that King Viśvāmitra’s son, Viśvaṇtara, had given the splendid
elephant, Rājyavardhana, to the Brahmans who were engaged in discussion, and King
Viśvāmitra heard the news, he became angry, and he sent for Prince Viśvaṇtara, and
ordered him to quit the country. Discarded by his father, Viśvaṇtara reflected that
he, striving after completest insight, clothed with the armour of virtue out of good
will towards the whole world, had given away even his elephant; that so long as he
dwelt at home he had bestowed gifts according to his <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>means; that dwelling in the penance-forest he had to strive intensely; that as he
was not capable of refusing requests, he would rather quit his home and go into the
penance-forest. Thereupon the Bodisat, after having pronounced a strong vow, went
to his wife, Madrī, and told her everything. As soon as she had heard his words she
joined the palms of her hands, and, with heart fearful of being parted from the loved
one, she said to the Bodisat, “O lord, if this be so, I too will go into the penance-forest.
Parted from you, O lord, I am not capable of living a single instant longer. And why?
As the sky when it is deprived of the moon, as the earth when it is deprived of water,
so is the wife who is deprived of her husband.”
</p>
<p>The Bodisat said, “There is no doubt that we must ultimately be parted, for such is
the way of the world. You are accustomed to excellent food and drink, clothes and
couches, and therefore you are of a very delicate constitution. In the penance forest
it is necessary to sleep on grass and leaves, to feed on roots, flowers, and fruits,
and to walk on a ground which is covered with millet and thorns and splinters, to
keep constantly to one kind of food, to practise magnanimity towards all beings, and
to offer hospitality to those who appear unexpectedly. As even there I shall undoubtedly
bestow gifts according to my means, you must feel absolutely no regret on that account.
Therefore you ought to think this over well for a time.”
</p>
<p>Madrī replied, “O lord, so long as I am able, I will follow after you.” The Bodisat
said, “If this be so, be mindful of your vow.”
</p>
<p>Then the Bodisat went to his father, paid him reverence with his head, and said, “O
father, be pleased to forgive me my fault, the giving away of the elephant. As I am
now going forth from the city into the forest, your treasury, O king, will not become
empty.” The king, losing his breath from grief at the parting, said with tremulous
voice, “O son, give up making presents and remain here.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>The Bodisat replied, “The earth and its mountains may perhaps be destined to overthrow;
but I, O lord of the earth, cannot turn aside my mind from giving.”
</p>
<p>After saying these words he went away, mounted a chariot along with his son, daughter,
and wife, and went forth from the good city; hundreds of thousands of the towns-people
and country folks attending him with lamentation. A certain man who heard this wailing
and lament, and saw such great crowds streaming towards the city-gate, asked another
man, “Hey, friend, wherefore has so great a multitude set up such a lamentation?”
“Honoured sir,” was the reply, “do not you know in what way the king’s own son has
been sent away from here, because he persistently took pleasure in giving?”
</p>
<p>When the prince, together with his wife and children, had reached the margin of the
forest, all the people who formed his retinue raised a loud cry of lament. But so
soon as it was heard, the Bodisat addressed the retinue which had come forth from
the good city, and ordered it to turn back, saying—
</p>
<p>“However long anything may be loved and held dear, yet separation from it is undoubtedly
imminent. Friends and relatives must undoubtedly be severed from what is dearest to
them, as from the trees of the hermitage wherein they have rested from the fatigues
of the journey. Therefore, when ye reflect that all over the world men are powerless
against separation from their friends, ye must for the sake of peace strengthen your
unsteady minds by unfailing exertion.”
</p>
<p>When the Bodisat had journeyed three hundred yojanas, a Brahman came to him and said,
“O Kshatriya prince, I have come three hundred yojanas because I have heard of your
virtue. It is meet that you should give me the splendid chariot as a recompense for
my fatigue.”
</p>
<p>Madrī could not bear this, and she addressed the Brahman in angry speech. “Alas! this
Brahman, who even in the forest entreats the king’s son for a gift, has a merciless
<span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>heart. Does no pity arise within him when he sees the prince fallen from his royal
splendour?” The Bodisat said, “Find no fault with the Brahman.”
</p>
<p>“Why not?”
</p>
<p>“Madrī, if there were no people of that kind who long after riches there would also
be no giving, and in that case how could we, inhabitants of the earth, become possessed
of insight? As giving and the other Pāramitās (or virtues essential to a Buddhaship)
rightly comprise the highest virtue, the Bodisats constantly attain to the highest
insight.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bodisat bestowed the chariot and horses on that Brahman with exceeding
great joy, and said, “O Brahman, by means of this gift of the chariot, a present free
from the blemish of grudging, may I be enabled to direct the car of the sinless law
directed by the most excellent Rishi!” When Viśvaṇtara had with exceeding great joy
bestowed on the Brahman the splendid chariot he took Prince Kṛishṇa on his shoulder,
and Madrī took Princess Jālinī.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4400src" href="#xd31e4400">3</a> They went forth into the forest, and at length arrived at the forest of penance.
</p>
<p>In that penance-forest Viśvaṇtara dwelt, after he had taken the vow which pleased
his heart. One day, when Madrī had gone to collect roots and fruits in the penance-forest,
a Brahman came to Viśvaṇtara, and said, “O prince of Kshatriya race, may you be victorious!
As I have no slave, and wander about alone with my staff, therefore is it meet that
you should give me your two children.” As the Bodisat, Viśvaṇtara, after hearing these
words, hesitated a little about giving his beloved children, the Brahman said to the
Bodisat—
</p>
<p>“O prince of Kshatriya race, as I have heard that you are the giver of all things,
therefore do I ask why you still ponder over this request of mine. You are renowned
all over the earth as the possessor of a compassion which <span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>gives away all things: you are bound to act constantly in conformity with this renown.”
</p>
<p>After hearing these words the Bodisat said to the Brahman, “O great Brahman, if I
had to give away my own life I should not hesitate for a single moment. How, then,
should I think differently if I had to give away my children? O great Brahman, under
these circumstances I have bethought me as to how the children, when given by me,
if I do give away these two children who have grown up in the forest, will live full
of sorrow on account of their separation from their mother. And inasmuch as many will
blame me, in that with excessive mercilessness I have given away the children and
not myself, therefore is it better that you, O Brahman, should take me.”
</p>
<p>Then said the Brahman to Viśvaṇtara, “O prince of Kshatriya race, descended from a
great kingly family, as I have perceived how all over this earth your virtue is extolled,
your goodness which takes pity on all beings—the presents, the hospitality, and the
honour with which you welcome Śramaṇas, Brahmans, and strangers, and fulfil all the
expectations of the poor and needy, the helpless and the hungry—it is not right that
I, after having come to you, should remain without a present and deprived of the fruit
of my journey, and that, with the knowledge that I have not obtained it, all the hopes
which my mind had cherished should be brought to nought. Therefore is it meet that
you, fulfilling my hopes, should give me the children. And why? One who gave away
the earth, clothed with the ocean as with a garment, possessing the corn-fields as
its incomparable eyes, the mighty hills as the upper parts of its body with breasts,
and supporting towns and villages, would not be equal in might to you.”
</p>
<p>When the Bodisat Viśvaṇtara had heard these words of the Brahman, he laid aside the
longing which clung to the children, saying to himself, “If I give the two children
to the Brahman, Madrī and I will feel the pain of parting with the children. But if
I do not give them <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>to him, then I shall prove faithless to my vow, and the Brahman, disappointed in his
hopes, will go away as he came. If he receives them, despairing grief for the loss
of my children will be my lot upon earth. If I act otherwise, I break my promise and
my vow disappears.”
</p>
<p>Then the Bodisat Viśvaṇtara determined to give up his beloved children, and he said,
“Well, then, this takes place in order that, by means of a hundred kinds of penance,
I, like a pillared transit bridge resembling the full moon with spotless visage, may
save from the sea of troubles, containing manifold terrors, those who sink into its
bottomless depths.” After he had uttered these words with an untroubled countenance,
his eyes filled with tears, and he gave his two children to the Brahman, and said,
“As I am to obtain a very great recompense in return for the gift of the children,
I shall save the world from the ocean of revolution.”
</p>
<p>Immediately after the surrender of the children, the earth quaked in a sixfold manner.
When the ascetics who dwelt in the forest, terrified by the earthquake, asked one
another by whose power the earth had been shaken in so intolerable a manner, and wished
to know who it was who possessed such power, an old ascetic of the Vaśishṭha race,
who was versed in the meanings of signs, made the matter known to them, saying, “The
earth has doubtless been set in movement because Viśvaṇtara, in order that he may
completely redeem men reduced to despair by trouble, has given up his two bright-eyed,
beloved children, who dwelt in the penance-forest, partaking of fruit and water.”
</p>
<p>Now, when the two children saw that their father was about to give them away, they
touched Viśvaṇtara’s feet, uttering mournful cries, and joining the palms of their
hands, and saying, “O father, will you give us away in the absence of our mother?
Be content to give us up after we have seen her.” Then the Bodisat gave way under
the grief which had laid hold of his mind, and his face <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>was wet with tears as he embraced his two children and said, “O children, in my heart
there is no unkindness, but only merciful compassion. As I have manifested virtue
for the salvation of the whole world, I give you away, whereby I may attain unto complete
insight, and, having myself obtained rest, may save the worlds which lie, deprived
of support, in the ocean of woes.”
</p>
<p>When the children perceived that their father’s resolve was firm to give them up,
they paid honour to his feet with their heads, laid their palms together, and said
with soft complaint, “If you have severed the cord, we have this to say: grant us
forbearance. O father, be pleased to utter the words. Every fault which we, as children,
have committed against you, our superior, or any words at any time uttered by us,
which displeased you, or anything in which, not obeying you, we have wrongly left
aught undone—grant us forgiveness of these things, regarding them as the faults of
children.”
</p>
<p>After they had thus spoken, and had paid reverence to their father, and three times
encompassed him, they went forth from the hermitage, ever looking back with tearful
eyes, keeping in their hearts those things which they had to say to their superior.
The Bodisat consoled them with compassionate words, and then, desiring to attain to
the highest insight, he betook himself to a hut made of leaves in the forest of penance.
</p>
<p>Scarcely had the children gone away when the system of the three thousand worlds quaked
six times. Many thousands of gods filled the air with sounds of shouting and rejoicing,
and cried, “Oh the great deed of surrender! Truly is he worthy of being wondered at,
whose mind remains constant even after the surrender of both his children.”
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Madrī had set off for the hermitage, carrying roots and fruits, and when
the earth shook, she hurried on all the faster towards the hermitage. A certain deity,
who perceived that she might hinder the surrender <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>which the Bodisat proposed to make for the salvation of the world, assumed the form
of a lioness, and barred her way. Then Madrī said to this wife of the King of the
Beasts, “O wife of the King of the Beasts, full of wantonness, wherefore do you bar
my way? In order that I may remain truly irreproachable, make way for me that I may
pass swiftly on. Moreover, you are the wife of the King of the Beasts, and I am the
spouse of the Lion of Princes, so that we are of similar rank. Therefore, O Queen
of the Beasts, leave the road clear for me.”
</p>
<p>When Madrī had thus spoken, the deity, who had assumed the form of the lioness, turned
aside from the way. Madrī reflected for a moment, recognising inauspicious omens,
for the air resounded with wailing notes, and the beings inhabiting the forest gave
forth sorrowful sounds, and she came to the conclusion that some disaster had certainly
taken place in the hermitage, and said, “As my eye twitches, as the birds utter cries,
as fear comes upon me, both my children have certainly been given away; as the earth
quakes, as my heart trembles, as my body grows weak, my two children have certainly
been given away.”
</p>
<p>With a hundred thousand similar thoughts of woe she hastened towards the hermitage.
Entering therein she looked mournfully around, and, not seeing the children, she sadly
with trembling heart followed the traces left on the ground of the hermitage. “Here
the boy Kṛishṇa and his sister were wont to play with the young gazelles; here is
the house which they twain made out of earth; these are the playthings of the two
children. As they are not to be seen, it is possible that they may have gone unseen
by me into the hut of foliage and may be sleeping there.” Thus thinking and hoping
to see the children, she laid aside the roots and fruits, and with tearful eyes embraced
her husband’s feet, asking, “O lord, whither have the boy and girl gone?” Viśvaṇtara
replied, “A Brahman came to me full of hope. To him have I given <span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>the two children. Thereat rejoice.” When he had spoken these words, Madrī fell to
the ground like a gazelle pierced by a poisoned arrow, and struggled like a fish taken
out of the water. Like a crane robbed of her young ones she uttered sad cries. Like
a cow, whose calf has died, she gave forth many a sound of wailing. Then she said,
“Shaped like young lotuses, with hands whose flesh is as tender as a young lotus leaf,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4433src" href="#xd31e4433">4</a> my two children are suffering, are undergoing pain, wherever they have gone. Slender
as young gazelles, gazelle-eyed, delighting in the lairs of the gazelles, what sufferings
are my children now undergoing in the power of strangers? With tearful eyes and sad
sobbing, enduring cruel sufferings, now that they are no longer seen by me, they live
downtrodden among needy men. They who were nourished at my breast, who used to eat
roots, flowers, and fruits, they who, experiencing indulgence, were ever wont to enjoy
themselves to the full, those two children of mine now undergo great sufferings. Severed
from their mother and their family, deserted by the cruelty of their relatives, thrown
together with sinful men, my two children are now undergoing great suffering. Constantly
tormented by hunger and thirst, made slaves by those into whose power they have fallen,
they will doubtless experience the pangs of despair. Surely I have committed some
terrible sin in a previous existence, in severing hundreds of beings from their dearest
ones. Therefore do I now lament like a cow which has lost its calf. If there exists
any exorcism, by which I can gain over all beings, so shall my two children, after
having been made slaves, be by it rendered free.”
</p>
<p>Then Madrī, looking upon the thick-foliaged trees which the children had planted and
tended, embraced them tenderly, and said, “The children fetched water in small pitchers,
and dropped water on the leaves. You, O trees, did the children suckle, as though
ye had been possessed <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>of souls.” Further on, when she saw the young gazelles with which the children used
to play, standing in the hermitage, she sadly said, gently wailing, “With the desire
of seeing their playfellows do the young gazelles visit the spot, searching among
the plants, offering companionship with my never-ending woe.” Afterwards, when the
footprints on the road along which the children had gone became interrupted, and she
saw that their footprints did not lie in a straight line, but in all sorts of directions,
she was seized by bitter anguish, and cried, “As the footprints point to dragging
along and some of them to swiftness of pace, you must surely have driven them on with
blows, O most merciless Brahman. How have my children fared with tender feet, their
throats breathing with difficulty, their voices reduced to weakness, their pretty
lower lips trembling, like gazelles timidly looking around?”
</p>
<p>Observing how she bore herself and uttered complaints, the Bodisat exerted himself
to exhort his wife with a series of such and such words about instability, and said:
“Not for the sake of renown, nor out of anger, have I given away your two children;
for the salvation of all beings have I given the children, whom it was hard to give.
By giving up the objects which it is hardest to give up, children and wife, may one,
like the great souls, attain to the completest insight. O Madrī, as I cling closely
to giving, I have given for the redemption of the world the children whom it was hard
to give. My purpose is to sacrifice all things, to give myself, my wife, my children,
and my treasures.”
</p>
<p>When after a time Madrī had recovered her strength of mind, she said to the Bodisat:
“I will in nothing be a hindrance to you. Let your mind be constant. If you wish to
give me too, give me without hesitation. As soon as, O courageous one, you have attained
to that, for the sake of which you give up that which is connected with difficulty,
save all beings from revolution.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the King of the Gods, Śakra, perceived this marvellous endurance on the part
of the Bodisat, and the striving of Madrī, and their deeds very hard to be accomplished,
he descended from heaven, surrounded by the company of the thirty-three gods, into
the hermitage and lighted it up with great brilliance. Remaining in the air, he said
to the Bodisat: “Inasmuch as after this fashion, O mighty one, in the foolish world,
the mind of which is bound fast by knots of ignorance, in the world which is fettered
by the bonds of a mind which pays homage to enjoyment, you alone, superior to passion,
have given up the children in whom you delighted, you have certainly attained to this
degree through stainless and joyless tranquillity.”
</p>
<p>After gratifying the Bodisat with these words, the King of the Gods, Śakra, said to
himself: “As this man, when alone and without support, might be driven into a corner,
I will ask him for Madrī.” So he took the form of a Brahman, came to the Bodisat,
and said to him: “Give me as a slave this lovely sister, fair in all her limbs, unblamed
by her husband, prized by her race.” Then in anger spake Madrī to the Brahman: “O
shameless and full of craving, do you long after her who is not lustful like you,
O refuse of Brahmans, but takes her delight according to the upright law.” Then the
Bodisat, Viśvaṇtara, began to look upon her with compassionate heart, and Madrī said
to him: “I have no anxiety on my own account, I have no care for myself; my only anxiety
is as to how you are to exist when remaining alone.” Then said the Bodisat to Madrī:
“As I seek after the height which surmounts endless anguish, no complaint must be
uttered by me, O Madrī, upon this earth. Do you, therefore, follow after this Brahman
without complaining. I will remain in the hermitage, living after the manner of the
gazelles.”
</p>
<p>When he had uttered these words, he said to himself with joyous and exceedingly contented
mind: “This gift here in this forest is my best gift. After I have here <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>absolutely given away Madrī too, she shall by no means be recalled.” Then he took
Madrī by the hand, and said to that Brahman: “Receive, O most excellent Brahman, this
my dear wife, loving of heart, obedient to orders, charming in speech, demeaning herself
as one of lofty race.”
</p>
<p>When, in order to attain to supreme insight, he had given away his beautiful wife,
the earth quaked six times to its extremities like a boat on the water. And when Madrī
had passed into the power of the Brahman, overcome by pain at being severed from her
husband, her son, and her daughter, with faltering breath and in a voice which huskiness
detained within her throat, she spoke thus: “What crime have I committed in my previous
existence that now, like a cow whose calf is dead, I am lamenting in an uninhabited
forest?” Then the King of the Gods, Śakra, laid aside his Brahman’s form, assumed
his proper shape, and said to Madrī: “O fortunate one, I am not a Brahman, nor am
I a man at all. I am the King of the Gods, Śakra, the subduer of the Asuras. As I
am pleased that you have manifested the most excellent morality, say what desire you
would now wish to have satisfied by me.”
</p>
<p>Rendered happy by these words, Madrī prostrated herself before Śakra, and said: “O
thou of the thousand eyes, may the lord of the three and thirty set my children free
from thraldom and let them find their way to their grandfather.” After these words
had been spoken the Prince of the Gods entered the hermitage and addressed the Bodisat.
Taking Madrī by the left hand, he thus spake to the Bodisat: “I give you Madrī for
your service. You must not give her to any one. If you give away what has been entrusted
to you, fault will be found with you.”
</p>
<p>Afterwards the King of the Gods, Śakra, deluded the Brahman who had carried off the
boy and girl, so that under the impression that it was another city, he entered the
selfsame city from which they had departed, and there <span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>set to work to sell the children. When the ministers saw this they told the king,
saying, “O king, your grandchildren, Kṛishṇa and Jālinī, have been brought into this
good city in order to be sold, by an extremely worthless Brahman.” When the king heard
these words, he said indignantly, “Bring the children here, forthwith.”
</p>
<p>When this command had been attended to by the ministers, and the townspeople had hastened
to appear before the king, one of the ministers brought the children before him. When
the king saw his grandchildren brought before him destitute of clothing and with foul
bodies, he fell from his throne to the ground, and the assembly of ministers, and
the women, and all who were present began to weep. Then the king said to the ministers:
“Let the bright-eyed one, who, even when dwelling in the forest, delights in giving,
be summoned hither at once, together with his wife.”
</p>
<p>After this the King of the Gods, Śakra, having paid reverence to the Bodisat, returned
to his own habitation.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Now, when King Viśvāmitra was dead, the Brahmans, the ministers, the towns-people,
and the country people, went to the hermitage and with entreaties invited the Bodisat
to come to the city. There they installed him as king. Thereafter King Viśvaṇtara
was known by the name of Viśvatyāga (all-giver). And after he had made presents of
various kinds to the <span class="corr" id="xd31e4464" title="Source: Sramaṇas">Śramaṇas</span>, Brahmans, the poor and needy, his friends and relations, his acquaintances and servants,
he uttered these ślokas: “In order to obtain supreme insight have I fearlessly bestowed
gifts on Kshatriyas, Brahmans, Vaiśyas, Sūdras, <span class="corr" id="xd31e4467" title="Source: Chandalas">Chaṇḍālas</span>, and Pukkasas, with gold and silver, oxen and horses, jewelled earrings, and labouring
slaves. For giving is the most excellent of virtues. With a heart free from passion
have I given away my wife and children, and obtained thereby power over men in this
and the other world.”
</p>
<p>As King Viśvāmitra had, for Viśvaṇtara’s sake, bestowed <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>great treasures on the Brahman Jujaka, who had thereby attained to great wealth, Jujaka’s
friends and relations, and those who were dear to him, came to him and said: “Your
property and wealth and high fortune all depend upon Viśvaṇtara.” He replied: “What
have I to do with Prince Viśvaṇtara? As I was born in the first caste, I have obtained
the recompense of the world, and therefore have I become so wealthy.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long past times King Sarjarasin<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4486src" href="#xd31e4486">2</a> reigned in Vārāṇasī, over that great, rich, prosperous, blissful, and populous city.
He took to wife the daughter of another king, and lived with her. She became with
child, and after the lapse of eight or nine months, when the sun was high at midday,
she gave birth to a very fine boy. When the boy’s birth-feast was held, and it was
asked what name should be given to him, the ministers said: “O king, as the boy was
born at the time when the sun [sūrya] is highest, let him be named Sūryanemi.<span class="corr" id="xd31e4489" title="Not in source">”</span> When he had received that name, he was entrusted to eight nurses, two for carrying,
two for suckling, two for cleansing, and two for playing. These eight nurses nourished
him with milk, curdled milk, butter, melted butter, butter-foam, and other excellent
kinds of food, and he grew apace like a lotus in a pool. When he had grown up he learnt
writing, reckoning, drawing, and hand-reckoning, and the arts and accomplishments
which befitted a prince of the Kshatriya race, destined to be a king. King Sarjarasin’s
first wife was named Dharmikā, and his prime minister, in whom the king placed the
greatest confidence, Goshṭhila.
</p>
<p>After some time Dharmikā again became with child. The diviners declared that a son
would be born, who would take the king’s life, and usurp royal power, setting the
diadem on his own head. After a time King Sarjarasin <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>fell ill, and when his illness could not be cured, although remedies of all kinds
were applied, he reflected, after he had learnt the state of his body, that it would
be necessary to take precautions in order that Sūryanemi, after becoming king on his
decease, should not cause Dharmikā to be put to death. So he determined to entrust
her to his minister, Goshṭhila, whom he had supplied with valuable property. Having
sent for him, he said to him: “Dharmikā is my first wife, you are my first minister.
As I am aware of my position, and I am undoubtedly about to lose my life, you must
out of love for me take care that Sūryanemi does not put Dharmikā to death.”
</p>
<p>The minister gave him a consoling promise. When Sarjarasin had died and his body had
been burned with all pomp, Sūryanemi was consecrated as king. He gave orders to his
ministers to put Dharmikā to death. Goshṭhila remonstrated against this, saying: “O
king, is it just to put her to death rashly? Who can tell whether she will bear a
son or a daughter? If a son is born, he shall be put to death.” King Sūryanemi ordered
him to act in accordance with this saying, and to keep watch over the queen. So Goshṭhila
took her to his own house, where, after eight or nine days, she gave birth to a son.
That same day a fisherman’s wife gave birth to a girl. Immediately after the confinement
Goshṭhila, who had gained over the fisherman’s wife with money, exchanged the children,
and told the king that Dharmikā had been delivered of a girl. The boy was suckled
and brought up by the fisherwoman. When he had grown up he learnt reading and writing,
and as he took to making verses, he was called the verse-writing fisher-lad.
</p>
<p>Goshṭhila informed Dharmikā that she had a son who was a poet, and she felt a desire
to see him. The minister tried to dissuade her from that, but she could not overcome
her longing. Goshṭhila saw how dangerous the matter was, and perceived that some precaution
must be taken, and he sent the lad to the queen with a fish. <span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>When the youth entered the palace the king became aware that this poetic fisher-lad
was he of whom of the diviners had predicted that he would take the king’s life, place
the diadem on his own head, and usurp the regal power. So he ordered the ministers
to lay hands on him in order that he might not escape. The youth heard of this as
the order passed from mouth to mouth, so he ran this way and that way until he came
to the house of an old woman who hid him away. From thence, after his body had been
anointed with oil of mustard and sesame, and laid upon a bier as if it had been a
corpse, he was carried out to the cemetery and deposited there. A man who was looking
for fruits and flowers there saw him get up and run away. The men who were sent in
pursuit of him asked this man if he had seen a person of such and such a height, and
such and such an appearance, going that way. He told them in what direction the youth
had gone, and they followed after him.
</p>
<p>The youth reached a hill-town, entered into the house of a dyer, and told him his
story. So when his pursuers began to search the town, the dyer placed the youth in
a clothes chest, which he set upon an ass, and so took him out of the town to a bath-house,
where he left him. The youth stood up, looked around on all four sides and went away.
But there also he was seen by a man, who disclosed the fact to his pursuers, and showed
them the road which he had taken. The youth came to another village, and entered the
house of a shoemaker, to whom he told his story, and whom he asked to make him a pair
of shoes, the toes of which should be where the heels generally are. The shoemaker
declared he had never made shoes of that kind. The youth replied in verse:—
</p>
<p>“Manifold is the mind, numerous are gifts. They cannot be weighed in the same scale.
So make me, O shoemaker, what I have ordered, with the heels in front.”
</p>
<p>According to these instructions, the shoemaker made him shoes of that kind. As the
town was surrounded <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>by a wall, the youth put on the shoes, crept out through a cistern, and got away.
His pursuers, following the traces left by his shoes, were led back by them to the
village, and they perceived that he had escaped. He took to the water, and was conveyed
by the Nāgas to their residence.
</p>
<p>As the news of this passed from mouth to mouth, King Sūryanemi learnt that the Nāgas
had received the youth into their dwelling-place. Thereupon he ordered his ministers
to summon into his presence all the snake-charmers who lived in his realm. When they
had done this, the king said to the snake-charmers, “Honoured sirs, go and question
the Nāgas in such and such a Nāga residence.” In compliance with the king’s orders,
the snake-charmers all betook themselves thither.
</p>
<p>Now a Yaksha named Pingala, who lived upon flesh and blood, dwelt in a certain wilderness.
As the wild beasts, not to speak of human beings, had deserted this wilderness from
fear of him, it was called the Pingala wilderness. When the snake-charmers made their
preparations for the purpose of endangering the Nāgas by spells, the youth became
frightened, and, knowing no other way of escape, fled into the Pingala-wilderness.
The Nāgas took counsel together, and decided that it would not be right if they were
not to save the youth from the Pingala-wilderness, and that it would do them a hurt
if he were to be killed by Pingala; but they did not know what to do. However, the
Nāga king told them to give information to the snake-charmers. The Nāgas said to them,
“Honoured ones, he on whose account ye have troubled us has been put to death by our
contrivance, for he has fled into the Pingala-wilderness.” The snake-charmers reported
the matter to the king, who gave orders to continue the search after the youth. Meanwhile
the youth took to wandering about in the Pingala-wilderness.
</p>
<p>The Yaksha Pingala was sitting at a certain spot surrounded by his dogs. When he and
his dogs saw the <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>youth from afar, he reflected that he had heard that the youth would kill him, and
he thought that he had come for that purpose. So he set the dogs on the youth. But
the youth outstripped them and climbed up a tree. Pingala and the dogs lay in wait
for him at the foot of the tree. Pingala asked him if he had not heard that a demon
named Pingala dwelt in the Pingala wilderness, and put to death all who came thither.
And he summoned him to come down, seeing that he must die. The youth replied, “So
long as I live I shall remain here.” As soon as the Yaksha Pingala, who had placed
himself in the shade with his ascetic’s cloth,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4513src" href="#xd31e4513">3</a> had gone to sleep, the youth threw down on him a part of his clothes. The dogs thought
that it was the youth who had fallen down, so they ate up the Yaksha Pingala and went
away.
</p>
<p>The youth slowly descended from the tree, and, after wandering to and fro, remembered
that he had an uncle, who had retired from the world among the Rishis, and he determined
to go to him. He lived in a hill district, in a grove which was well provided with
excellent roots, flowers, fruit, and water, with clumps of various trees, and with
the song of different kinds of birds. By means of inquiries the youth gradually made
his way thither, and he informed his uncle of his relationship to him, and took up
his abode with him. But even there the king’s men searched for him, and they were
on the point of laying hands on him, when he jumped down a precipice. As he sprang
into the air, a man seized hold of his head-dress, and the head-dress remained in
the man’s hands. As the pursuers supposed that he was dead, they determined to go
away. So they took the head-dress, and went to the king, and said to him, “O king,
the fisher-lad poet is dead, here is his head-dress.” And the king provided them with
good things.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p>After a while a deity, who dwelt in the Rishi-grove, said to that Rishi, “Do not you
take any interest, then, in your nephew, who is reduced to despair, subjected to intolerable
woes?” The Rishi replied, “If I keep him in mind no more, may I die upon the spot!”
The Rishi was in possession of spells and magic formulas, and knew one spell by which
a man might be turned into a woman and back again into a man. This spell he taught
to his nephew, and said to him, “Now, go away, and be fearless and free from anxiety.”
The youth, by means of the spell, assumed the form of an incomparably beautiful woman,
and betook himself to Vārāṇasī. While abiding in the king’s park he was seen by the
keeper, who was astounded, and set off instantly and informed King Sūryanemi, saying,
“O king, a woman of supreme beauty and youth is dwelling in the park.” The king ordered
him to fetch the woman. By the powerful dispensation of fortune the woman was brought
to the palace, and King Sūryanemi became violently enamoured of her. But when an opportunity
occurred, the youth put the king to death in a solitary spot. Then he reversed the
spell and became a man again. Afterwards he set the crown on his head, and, after
making the minister Goshṭhila acquainted with the matter, assumed the regal power.
A deity said in a śloka, “He whose head has not been cut off, he is not dead. He gets
up again and completes his work. Like unto the poet, when he found his opportunity
and slew the son of Sarjarasin.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long past times, a king came to the throne in the palace of a country well provided
with riches, prosperity, good harvests, and numerous inhabitants. Some time afterwards
his wife became with child, and, after the lapse of eight or nine months, gave birth
to a very handsome boy, complete in limbs and joints, whose skin was the colour of
gold, whose head stood out like a canopy, and who had long arms, a broad forehead,
interlacing eyebrows, and a high-arched nose. At his birth there occurred many thousands
of happy events. When his birth-feast was held, and the question arose as to giving
him a name, the ministers said, “O king, as many thousands of happy events have taken
place at his birth, let him be called Ksheman·kara.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4534src" href="#xd31e4534">2</a><span class="corr" id="xd31e4536" title="Not in source">”</span> This name was given to him, and he was entrusted to eight nurses, two to carry him,
two to suckle him, two to cleanse him, and two to play with him. These nurses brought
him up on various milk products and other excellent forms of nourishment, so that
he shot up like a lotus in a pool.
</p>
<p>The king’s wife again became with child, and after the lapse of eight or nine months
a boy was born, at whose birth many thousands of unfortunate events took place, on
which account there was given to him the name of Pāpan·kara.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4540src" href="#xd31e4540">3</a> He also thrived apace and grew up.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>The young Ksheman·kara, who was of a friendly and merciful nature, and compassionate
towards all living creatures, loved to give, taking his delight in bestowing, and
conferred gifts upon the <span class="corr" id="xd31e4548" title="Source: Śramanas">Śramaṇas</span> and Brahmans, the poor and the needy who begged of him. His father said to him, “O
son, do not be constantly making presents. If you give away so freely, where are we
to find the necessary riches?”
</p>
<p>Now, in accordance with the nature of things, many men take delight in gifts and giving,
and when they thus delight themselves their fame is extolled in words and verses,
and celebrated in all parts of the world. The king of another country, who had heard
of the great virtues of the prince, wished to give him his daughter. The prince’s
father was highly pleased, and wanted to go to meet her. But Ksheman·kara said, “Until
I have acquired wealth I will not marry. Allow me, O father, to go to sea.” He replied,
“Do so.” When he set forth for the sea with his merchandise, his brother, Pāpan·kara,
said to himself—
</p>
<p>“As he is now liked and loved by many men, he will be still more liked and loved by
many men when he shall have equipped a sea-ship and have returned home. And as there
will be an opportunity of his being invested with the regal power during our father’s
lifetime, therefore I, too, instead of remaining here to see whose turn will come,
will go to sea along with him, and will take away his life out there, and then I shall
be invested with the heirship even against my father’s will.” With these thoughts
in his mind he went to his father, and said to him, “O father, as Ksheman·kara is
going to sea I will go with him.” His father said, “Do so.”
</p>
<p>Now Ksheman·kara ordered proclamation to be made throughout the land as follows: “Listen,
O honourable merchants inhabiting the city. As Prince Ksheman·kara is going to sea
with merchandise, and as he among you who is inclined to go to sea under Prince Ksheman·kara’s
guidance will be freed from tolls, taxes, and freight-money, <span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>therefore get ready the goods which are to be taken to sea.” Many hundreds of merchants
got ready goods to be taken to the sea. Then Ksheman·kara, as the leading trader,
accompanied by his brother Pāpan·kara, after performing ceremonies for the sake of
obtaining a successful result, surrounded by many hundreds of merchants, taking with
him in waggons, carts, chests, and hampers, and on camels, oxen, and asses, quantities
of goods to be transported by sea, set out on his way. Visiting lands, towns, villages,
commercial emporiums, and estates, he came by degrees to the sea-coast. There he purchased
a ship for five hundred kārshāpaṇas, and after making proclamation three times, set
out on the ocean, taking with him five hundred servants, diggers, cleansers, fishermen,
mariners, and pilots. When on board ship he said to his brother Pāpan·kara: “Should
a shipwreck take place in the middle of the ocean, then throw your arms round my neck
without hesitation.” Pāpan·kara replied, “Good, I will do so.”
</p>
<p>After a time the ship arrived with a favourable wind at the Island of Jewels, and
the steersman said: “Listen, O honourable merchants of Jambudvīpa! as ye have heard
that the Island of Jewels is a mine of diamonds, lapis lazuli, turquoises, emeralds,
and divers other precious stones, therefore have we come hither. Now then, take yourselves
as many jewels as ye wish.”
</p>
<p>They searched for them with joy and desire, and they filled the ship full, as though
with rice, pease, sesame, and the like. Now, as Bodisats are wise and sharp-witted,
Prince Ksheman·kara made fast to his girdle some large jewels of great value. On the
way back, when not far from shore, the ship was rendered useless in consequence of
an injury inflicted by a sea monster. Therefore Pāpan·kara threw his arms round the
neck of Ksheman·kara, who by great exertions brought him ashore. Exhausted by the
burden, Ksheman·kara fell asleep. As he lay sleeping, Pāpan·kara caught sight of the
jewels fastened to his <span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>girdle, and thought: “Ought I to return with empty hands while he comes back with
such jewels?” Then he took away the jewels from his soundly sleeping brother, put
both his eyes out with a thorn, and left him sightless on the ocean shore.
</p>
<p>By a fortunate chance some oxherds who were tending their cattle came to that spot.
When they saw the prince, they said, “Ho, friend, who are you?” He told them everything
that had occurred. When they had heard his story they were filled with compassion,
and they led him to the house of the chief herdsman. There he took to playing on the
lute. The chief herdsman’s wife, who was charmed by his youth and beauty, heard the
sound of his lute and tried to allure him. But he, thinking of a course of life acquired
by good deeds, closed his ears and did not stir. As there is nothing which they may
not do who are seized by desire, she said to her husband: “This blind man is trying
to tempt me, will you put up with such people?” The prince reflected that, of all
kinds of anger, the worst is the anger of a wife, and perceived that there was nothing
left for him, in order not to be smitten thereby, but to go away. So he left the house,
and along all manner of streets, market places, and by-roads, he gained himself a
living by his music.
</p>
<p>On the death of his father his brother, Pāpan·kara, came to the throne. And after
a time he himself arrived at the town of that neighbouring king who had formerly wished
to give him his daughter in marriage. She had by this time grown up, but when there
came to woo her the sons of kings, ministers, and purohitas, dwelling in many lands,
her father said: “O daughter, Prince Ksheman·kara, for whom I had intended you, went
to sea and there died in consequence of a misfortune. As suitors have now arrived,
and as those who do not obtain you will be discontented, the question arises, what
is to be done?” She replied: “O father, if this be the case, let orders be given to
have the city swept and garnished; I will choose a husband for myself.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the king ordered proclamation to be made in the different lands and cities that
his daughter was going to choose herself a husband. He also gave orders that his own
city should be cleared of stones, potsherds, and rubble, sprinkled with sandalwood
water, and perfumed with odours, and that canopies, standards, and flags, should be
set up, and numerous silken hangings displayed, together with flowers of many kinds,
giving the appearance of a grove of the gods, and that joy-inspiring proclamation
should be made to this effect: “O honourable dwellers in town and country, and crowds
of men assembled from various lands, give ear! To-morrow the king’s daughter will
choose herself a husband. So do ye assemble as is fitting.”
</p>
<p>Next morning the king’s daughter, adorned with many ornaments and surrounded by numerous
maidens, came to a grove made bright with flowers by the deity of the grove, rendered
extremely beautiful by the dispensation of great good fortune. And when several thousand
men had assembled in the midst of the city, she came into the assembly in order to
choose herself a husband. Somewhat removed sat Ksheman·kara playing on the lute.
</p>
<p>As men by their deeds are reciprocally connected, and the force of effect is constrained
by the great power of cause, so it came to pass that the king’s daughter, when her
feelings were moved by the sound of the lute, became closely attached to Ksheman·kara’s
playing, and she threw him the crown of flowers, crying, “This man is my husband.”
</p>
<p>The assembled people were discontented, and some of them in bitterness of heart began
to find fault with her, saying, “What sense is there in this, that the royal princess,
who has so much beauty, and who is so supremely young and accomplished, should slight
the sons of kings, ministers, and purohitas, who have come from many lands, besides
excellent householders, and should choose a blind man to be her husband?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span></p>
<p>With reluctance and discontent did the officials convey the tidings to the king, saying,
“O king, the princess has completed the choice of a husband.” The king said, “What
manner of man has she chosen?” They replied, “O king, a blind man.” The king also
was displeased when he heard this, and he sent for his daughter and said, “O daughter,
wherefore have you chosen such a man as your husband, in spite of there being extremely
young, rich and handsome sons of kings, proprietors, merchants, caravan leaders, ministers,
and purohitas?” She replied, “O father, this is the man I want.” The king said, “O
daughter, if that be so, then go to him. Wherefore do you delay?” She went to him
and said, “I have chosen you as my husband.” He replied, “Therein you have not acted
well. Perhaps you have thought, ‘as such is the case and this man is blind, I can
give myself to another.’ ” She replied, “I am not one who does such things.” He said,
“What proof is there of this?” She replied, commencing an asseveration—
</p>
<p>“If it be true, and my asseveration is righteous, that I have been in love only with
Prince Ksheman·kara and with you, but with none else, then through the power of this
truth and my asseveration shall one of your two eyes become sound as before.”
</p>
<p>So soon as this asseveration was uttered, one of his eyes came again just as it was
before. Then he said, “I am Ksheman·kara. My brother Pāpan·kara reduced me to the
state I was in.” She said, “What proof is there that you are Prince Ksheman·kara?”
Then he too began to asseverate, saying—
</p>
<p>“If it be true, and my asseveration righteous, that although Pāpan·kara put out my
eyes, I do not in the least bear him malice, then in consequence of the truth and
affirmation may my other eye become sound as before.”
</p>
<p>So soon as he had pronounced this asseveration, his other eye also became as it had
been originally. Then <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>the royal princess betook herself to the king, along with Ksheman·kara, who was no
longer imperfect in any part of his body, and said, “O father, this is Ksheman·kara
himself.” As the king was incredulous, she told him how everything had come about.
The king was exceedingly astonished, but with great joy did he give his daughter to
Ksheman·kara as his wife. Then he set forth with a great army for that city, and drove
Pāpan·kara from power, and set Ksheman·kara as king upon his father’s throne.

<p class="first">In long past times a hunter wounded an elephant with a poisoned arrow. Perceiving
that he had hit it, he followed after the arrow and killed the elephant. Five hundred
robbers who had plundered a hill-town were led by an evil star to that spot, where
they perceived the elephant. As it was just then a time of hunger with them, they
said, “Now that we have found this meat, let two hundred and fifty of us cut the flesh
off the elephant and roast it, while two hundred and fifty go to fetch water.”
</p>
<p>Then those among them who had cut the flesh off the elephant and cooked it, said among
themselves, “Honoured sirs, now that we have accomplished such a task and collected
so much stolen property, wherefore should we give away part of it to the others? Let
us eat as much of the meat as we please, and then poison the rest. The others will
eat the poisoned meat and die, and then the stolen goods will be ours.”
</p>
<p>So after they had eaten their fill of the meat, they poisoned what remained over.
Those who had gone to fetch water, likewise, when they had drunk as much water as
they wanted, poisoned what was left. So when they came back, and those who had eaten
the flesh drank the water, and those who had drunk the water ate the flesh, they all
of them died.
</p>
<p>Now there came to that spot a jackal, fettered by the ties <span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>of time, and it saw all those dead bodies. With a joy that sprang from greediness
it thought, “As an extremely large amount of booty has accrued to me, I will take
each part of it in its turn.” So it seized the bow with its jaws, and began to <span class="corr" id="xd31e4605" title="Source: knaw">gnaw</span> at the knots of the bowstring. The string snapped, and the end of the bow struck
the jackal in the roof of the mouth so hard, that it died. The jackal uttered this
śloka—
</p>
<p>“It is good to accumulate, but not to accumulate immoderately. See how the jackal,
infatuated by greed after the accumulated, was killed by the bow.”

<h2 class="main"><i>THE MAGICIAN’S PUPIL.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4617src" href="#xd31e4617">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long past times, King Brahmadatta lived in Vārāṇasī. There also a Chaṇḍāla<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4621src" href="#xd31e4621">2</a> lived, who was versed in spells and magic lore, and who, employing the Gāndhāra-Mantra,
was wont to obtain by spells from the Gandhamādana mountain<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4625src" href="#xd31e4625">3</a> such fruits and flowers as were not in season, and to present them to king Brahmadatta.
The King who was highly pleased thereby, made him presents. Now there was a Brahman
youth who longed after a knowledge of spells. And in his search after them, in accordance
with what he heard spoken thereof, he came from his own country to Vārāṇasī. After
he had recovered from the fatigues of his journey, he betook himself to the Brahman
who was versed in spells and magic lore. And when he came before him, he said—
</p>
<p>“I wish to serve the Paṇḍit.”
</p>
<p>“Why?”
</p>
<p>“For the sake of learning magic.”
</p>
<p>The Chaṇḍāla replied in verse, “Magic lore is communicated to no man. It dies with
its possessor. Or it is vouchsafed to him who has knowledge and means and renders
service.”
</p>
<p>The youth said, “O Paṇḍit, if such is the case, and I <span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>have to render service, I ask for how long a time must that be.”
</p>
<p>“When you have served twelve years,” was the reply, “it will be seen whether I shall
communicate it to you or not.”
</p>
<p>As the youth had a great craving after magic lore, he agreed to this, and after he
had with the greatest joy testified his respect, he entered upon his service.
</p>
<p>It happened once that the Chaṇḍāla came home drunk, and the Brahman youth said to
himself, “As the master has drunk so much more than is befitting, I will lie down
to sleep beside him.” The Chaṇḍāla took to tossing about on his bed, and as he did
so one side of the bed gave way. The noise this made awoke the Brahman youth, who
said to himself: “As the master is so restless in his sleep, I will support the bed
with my back.” Accordingly he propped up the bed with his back, and patiently held
out all night [in spite of much discomfort,]<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4641src" href="#xd31e4641">4</a> thinking that if he moved his body, or uttered a word, the teacher would hear the
noise he made, and would awake, and be unable to go to sleep again.
</p>
<p>When the Chaṇḍāla awoke of his own accord, and saw the youth, he asked who was there.
The youth replied, “O teacher, it is I, the companion of your fortunes,” and he told
him all that had occurred. The Chaṇḍāla was greatly delighted, and said, “O son, as
I am exceedingly pleased, I will teach you the art of magic.”
</p>
<p>As Brahmans are of a conceited nature, the youth could not restrain himself, but must
needs immediately make a trial of his magic art on the spot, and then depart. So he
employed his magic power, and soared into the sky. When he came to Gandhamādana, he
there plucked fruits and flowers which were out of season on earth, and gave them
to the king’s purohita, who gave them to King <span class="corr" id="xd31e4648" title="Source: Brahmadatra">Brahmadatta</span>. The king asked where he had got them. The purohita replied—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span></p>
<p>“There is a Brahman youth here from a distant country. He it is who gave them to me.
As he is extremely well versed in spells and magic lore, and as the Brahman is of
a better nature than the Chaṇḍāla, who is despised by the whole world, the question
arises of what is to be done with the Chaṇḍāla. Be pleased to take away his employment
from the Chaṇḍāla, and to confer it upon the Brahman youth.”
</p>
<p>The king replied, “Do so.” Accordingly the Chaṇḍāla was deprived of his employment
by the purohita, who conferred it upon the Brahman youth. But in consequence of the
youth’s ingratitude his magic power deserted him.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In lost past times, in a palace in a land every way blest, there reigned a king to
whom his wife bore four sons, named Śākha, Gulma, Anugulma, and Viśākha. After having
all grown up, and taken to themselves as wives kings’ daughters from other lands,
they began to behave disrespectfully to the king. The king banished them, and they
departed, along with their wives, and came to a desert place, where their means of
sustenance ran short. So they made an agreement among themselves to put their wives
to death one after another, and by feeding on their flesh to make their own way through
the desert. Viśākha, however, was of opinion that it would be better to sacrifice
his own life than to take away another’s, and instead of waiting to see who was to
die he determined to escape along with his wife. So he fled away with her. But after
a time she said, being exhausted by the want of food and drink, and by the fatigue
of the journey, “O lord, I am dying.” Viśākha thought that it would be sad if she
were to die now, after he had saved her from the hands of the Rākshasas (or cannibals).
So he sliced some flesh off his hams and gave it to her to eat, and then he opened
the veins of both his arms and gave her the blood to drink. In this way they made
their way to a mountain, on which they supported themselves with roots and berries.
</p>
<p>At the foot of this mountain ran a river, into which a <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>man happened to fall, whose hands and feet had been cut off. Carried away by the stream
he uttered cries of despair. Viśākha, who was gathering roots and berries somewhere
thereabouts, heard his cries for help. His mind being stirred with compassion he climbed
the mountain, and began looking about on all sides. As soon as he saw the man being
swept away by the waters, he ran swiftly down from the mountain, sprang into the river,
seized the man, and conveyed him ashore. Affected by the sight of his misery he said
to him, “O son, whence do you come?” When the man had told him the whole story, Viśākha
spoke words of solace to him, satisfied his hunger with roots and berries, and then
handed him over to his wife, thanks to whose care he recovered entirely. With this
care there was associated pleasure, which induced her to pay him frequent visits,
passing the time in varied talk.
</p>
<p>It is part of the nature of things that Bodisats are not remarkably addicted to the
passion of love, and so it happened that Viśākha indulged only from time to time in
amorous pleasure. As, in consequence of the Bodisat’s power, trees, roots, and berries
possessed a special force, living upon them excited the desires of the wife, and she
began to allure the man who had no hands or feet. The cripple was unwilling to respond
to her advances, pointing out that he, when as good as dead, had been saved and restored
to life by her husband; and that if he were to behave in such a way he would be putting
himself into a position like unto that of a murderer. But as she repeatedly tempted
him, and it was hard for him to master passion, he finally acceded to her request.
</p>
<p>Although in the fruition of love passion increased, yet he reflected that, as she
was now so possessed by passion, and as of all enmities that of the woman is the worst,
he was going to ruin. In accordance with these ideas, he began to take counsel with
her, saying, “If your husband finds out that we have lived together, he will undoubtedly
do you some injury and put me to death.” She was of <span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>opinion that these words were true, and that precautions must be taken. As women are
adroit, even without being taught, she wrapped a cloth round her head and lay down
on a rock to sleep. When Viśākha saw her sleeping there, as he returned home with
roots and berries, he asked her, “Good wife, what is the matter with you?” She replied,
“O lord, as my head aches, I feel very unwell.” Viśākha said, “What can be done?”
As she had seen wolf’s-milk<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4676src" href="#xd31e4676">2</a> growing in a ravine, she said, “O lord, when I once before suffered from this pain
in the head, the physician ordered me wolf’s-milk, by means of which I was cured.”
Viśākha replied, “I will seek for wolf’s-milk.” She said, “As it grows in this ravine,
I will let you down with a rope and you shall fetch it up.” As august beings are simple
and upright, he suspected no guile, and said, “Let us do so; you hold the rope and
I will fetch the wolf’s-milk.” When he had let himself down with the rope, she let
go of the rope with her hand, whereby he also lost hold of it and fell into the water
at the bottom.
</p>
<p>As the Bodisat was destined to long life and the exercise of regal power, he did not
die, but was carried along by the stream, and so he reached a royal city. The king
of that city had died without leaving any heirs, and the ministers and the towns-people
and the country-folk were holding counsel as to whom, seeing there was no king, they
should invest with the sovereignty. They chose men well versed in omens, and they
ordered them to seek out a man provided with virtuous merit, in order that they might
invest him with the sovereignty. As the deeds which were to secure sovereignty for
Viśākha were now approaching maturity, he emerged from the water and sat down on a
spot which, through the power of the Bodisat, appeared as though decked with ornaments.
To this spot came the diviners, and when they saw the august being <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>provided with the marks of sovereignty, they betook themselves to the ministers, full
of joy and bliss, and told them that they had found in their researches a being provided
with much virtuous merit, whom the sovereignty would befit. Thereupon the ministers
caused the road and the city to be cleansed, and prosperously conducted him into the
city, and installed him as king on the fitting day, at the fitting hour, under the
fitting constellation.
</p>
<p>As he had no wife, the ministers, the purohitas, and the kings of other lands, as
well as other people, proprietors, merchants, and caravan leaders, all brought their
daughters to that city, adorned with all sorts of ornaments, in order that they might
be received into the palace. But the king, who had been so shamefully treated by his
wife, did not consent to that. The ministers said, “O king, it is not customary for
kings to be without wives, princes, ministers, and inhabitants of town and country;
so be pleased to nominate a spouse. Kings and grandees living in all manner of districts,
and grandees from foreign lands, have their daughters in readiness to be exhibited
to you.” But he was not to be induced to consent thereto, and he reviled women without
ceasing.
</p>
<p>Now as all things good for fruition derive their force and completeness from the power
of the virtuous merits of beings, it came to pass that, after the Bodisat was thrown
down from the mountain through the misdeed of his wife, the roots and berries of that
mountain shrivelled and lost their power. Thereupon the woman, fearing to perish in
the hour of hunger, having taken the cripple on her back, betook herself to the villages,
and asked for alms in the streets, market-places, cross-roads, and by-roads. When
she was questioned she always replied, “My husband has never found fault with me.”
And as a wife, with whom her husband has never found fault, is wont to be highly respected
in the world, she obtained alms wherever she went. When she arrived at the capital,
and the inhabitants heard of her, they were seized with astonishment. <span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>Some of them went forth full of wonder to see her. And the dwellers in the city took
to asking if that king, who always had something to say against all women, ought not
to look upon this excellent female wanderer, whose husband had never found fault with
her, and who carried on her back the handless and footless cripple. When the purohita
had made the king acquainted with these sayings the king thought the matter over,
and gave orders that this woman should be summoned, as he wished to see her. When
she had been sent for, and he had seen her, he laughingly uttered this verse—
</p>
<p>“Thou who hast eaten the flesh of my loins, who hast drunk my blood, and hast taken
the cripple on thy back, wilt thou not now be blamed by thy husband?
</p>
<p>“After having, for the sake of wolf’s-milk, flung me down the precipice, after having
taken the cripple on thy back, wilt thou not now be blamed by thy husband?”
</p>
<p>She stood still with drooping countenance and heart full of shame. When the ministers
had asked the king about this matter, and he had given them a full account of all
that had taken place, they drove the woman out of the city with contumely.

<p class="first">At a long distant period there stood on the shore of a lake a vilva<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4708src" href="#xd31e4708">2</a> forest. In this forest dwelt six hares.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4714src" href="#xd31e4714">3</a> Now a vilva tree in that forest fell into the lake, thereby producing a great noise.
When the six hares heard this noise, they began, as they had but small bodies, to
run away full of fear. The jackals saw them running, and asked, “O honoured ones,
wherefore do ye run?” The hares replied, “There was a great noise.” Thereupon the
jackals also took to flight. When the monkeys saw them running they asked, “O honoured
ones, wherefore do ye run?” The jackals replied, “There was a great noise.” Thereupon
the monkeys also took to flight. When the gazelles saw them running they asked, “O
honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The monkeys replied, “There was a great noise.”
Thereupon the gazelles also took to flight. When the boars saw them running they asked,
“O honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The gazelles replied, “There was a noise.”
Thereupon the boars also took to flight. When the buffaloes saw them running they
asked, “O honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The boars replied, “There was a noise.”
Thereupon the buffaloes also took to flight. When the rhinoceroses saw them running
they asked, “O honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The buffaloes replied, “There
was a noise.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>Thereupon the rhinoceroses also took to flight. When the elephants saw them running
they asked, “O honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The rhinoceroses replied, “There
was a noise.” Thereupon the elephants also took to flight. When the bears saw them
running they asked, “O honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The elephants replied,
“There was a noise.” Thereupon the bears also took to flight. When the hyænas saw
them running they asked, “O honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The bears replied,
“There was a noise.” Thereupon the hyænas also took to flight. When the panthers saw
them running they asked, “O honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The hyænas replied,
“There was a noise.” Thereupon the panthers also took to flight. When the tigers saw
them running they asked, “O honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The panthers replied,
“There was a noise.” Thereupon the tigers also took to flight. When the lions saw
them running they asked, “O honoured ones, wherefore do ye run?” The tigers replied,
“There was a loud noise.” Thereupon the lions also took to flight. At the foot of
the mountain there dwelt a maned lion, which likewise seemed to wear a diadem. When
it saw the lions running it asked, “O honoured ones, wherefore do ye all run, although
each of you is strong in claws and strong in teeth?” The lions replied, “There was
a loud noise.” “O honoured ones, whence did the noise come?” it asked. “We do not
know,” they replied. Then said that lion, “O honoured ones, do not run. Inquiry must
be made as to where the noise came from.” It asked the tigers, “Who told you about
it?” The tigers replied, “The panthers.” It asked the panthers, “Who was it told you?”
The panthers replied, “The hyænas.” It asked the hyænas, “Who was it told you?” The
hyænas replied, “The bears.” It asked the bears, “Who was it told you?” The bears
replied, “The elephants.” It asked the elephants, “Who was it told you?” The elephants
replied, “The rhinoceroses.” It asked the <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>rhinoceroses, “Who was it told you?” The rhinoceroses replied, “The buffaloes.” It
asked the buffaloes, “Who was it told you?” The buffaloes replied, “The boars.” It
asked the boars, “Who was it told you?” The boars replied, “The gazelles.” It asked
the gazelles, “Who was it told you?” The gazelles replied, “The monkeys.” It asked
the monkeys, “Who was it told you?” The monkeys replied, “The jackals.” It asked the
jackals, “Who was it told you?” The jackals replied, “The hares.” It asked the hares,
“Who was it told you?” The hares replied, “We saw the terrible thing with our own
eyes. Come, we will show you whence the noise came.” So they guided the lion, and
showed it the vilva forest, saying, “That is where the noise came from.” Inasmuch
as the noise was caused by the fall of a vilva tree out of that forest into the lake,
the lion said: “O honoured ones, be not afraid, for that was only an empty sound.”
Consequently they were all tranquillised. And a deity uttered this verse: “Let not
men believe in words. They ought to see everything for themselves. Observe how, through
the fall of a vilva, the forest lost its beasts.”

<h2 class="main"><i>THE FIVE LOVERS.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4729src" href="#xd31e4729">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A merchant had a wife with whom four of the city stipendiaries and their superior
officer fell in love, and they all sent go-betweens to her. She listened to what they
said, and appointed a time for a meeting. But when they asked where the meeting-place
was to be, she directed them to a fig-tree which stood not far from the city, the
head of which soared aloft towards the sky, the branches of which were widespread,
and the foliage of which was thick. Up this tree they were to climb, and there to
await her. She herself awaited an opportunity of going out of the house. But her husband
became suspicious, beat her, and bound her to a pillar. She had told one of the four
lovers that he was to climb on to a branch on the eastern side of the tree, and she
would come by daybreak. He did so joyfully. The second one, likewise by her instruction,
climbed on to a branch on the south side of the tree, the third mounted on the western
side, and the fourth on the north side, and the superior officer clambered on to a
branch in the middle of the tree. They spent the whole night on the tree in expectation,
terrified by the wind, all by themselves. For the woman did not come although the
day dawned. Then he who was waiting on the eastern branch uttered this verse: “The
sun has risen, from the village comes the ploughman. The fig-tree must learn that
the false do not come.”
</p>
<p>He who was waiting on the southern branch said: “The <span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>woman who was to come is truly false. This sun full of splendour is now about to rise.”
</p>
<p>He who was on the eastern side said: “Wilt thou come, excellent one? Being asked this,
she replied, ‘Yes.’ ”
</p>
<p>Then he who sat on the western branch uttered this verse: “As the sun has risen on
the right hand, the ploughers go forth from the village. As I knew not the appointed
time, I have not closed my eyes during the night.”
</p>
<p>After a while he who sat on the northern branch said: “The wind has shaken me the
whole night long. He who goes after strange women suffers thus and in other ways.”
</p>
<p>Then said the superior officer: “If the wind has shaken you well, I shall not complain.
The fig-tree, in nought to blame, complains that its branches are broken.”
</p>
<p>The deity who dwelt in the tree, seeing that they were tricked, said: “You will complain,
and the four others too. When the Vaiśākha month<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4742src" href="#xd31e4742">2</a> comes, the tree which men have maimed recovers.”
</p>
<p>Having given up their hopes with respect to the woman, the men came down from the
tree and went homewards. But the woman had been released by her husband, and she betook
herself secretly to that tree. When they saw her they asked her why she had deceived
them. She told them the whole story. They said, “So you are now come to light!” As
she reflected that she could not have to do with five men after the fashion of dogs,
she said that she would yield herself to him among them who should bring her the most
beautiful flowers. Now there was in the royal castle a keeper of the king’s lotuses,
whose nose and ears had been cut off. To him they betook themselves. But they thought
that they would certainly get nothing from him by way of purchase, though they might
if they flattered him. So one of them said: “As the bulrush <span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>grows again after being cut, so may your nose grow again. Give flowers to him who
prays.”
</p>
<p>The second said: “As the kuśa grass grows again after being mown, so may your nose
grow again. Give lotuses to him who prays.”
</p>
<p>The third said: “As the Dūrvā grass<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4753src" href="#xd31e4753">3</a> and the Vīraṇa<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4759src" href="#xd31e4759">4</a> grow again even when cut down, so may your nose grow again. Give flowers to him who
prays.”
</p>
<p>The fourth said: “As hair and beard, although shorn, yet grow again, so may your nose
grow again. Give flowers to him who prays.”
</p>
<p>The fifth said: “The lotus-cravers have all talked nonsense to you. Whether you give
lotuses, or do not give them, your nose will never <span class="corr" id="xd31e4767" title="Source: grown">grow</span> again.”
</p>
<p>The watchman said to himself: “Those four men have talked to me useless stuff. But
the fifth has kept steadily to the truth. To him will I give the lotuses.”
</p>
<p>So he gave him as many lotuses as he wanted. That man went joyfully with them to the
woman, whose enjoyment now fell to his share.

<h2 class="main"><i>THE VIRTUOUS ANIMALS.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4780src" href="#xd31e4780">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the long past times there lived in a dense forest four animals: a partridge,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4789src" href="#xd31e4789">2</a> a hare, a monkey, and an elephant. As they had become attached to each other, they
lived together in harmony and full content, and spent their time joyfully, without
fear or strife. But after some time it occurred to them that although, actuated by
a reciprocal attachment, they lived without strife in full content, yet as they did
not know which of their number they ought most to esteem, honour, and revere, they
must for that purpose investigate their several ages. So they began to take counsel
with one another, in order to find out which of them was the oldest. Then the partridge
pointed out a fig-tree, and said: “O honoured ones, at what periods of its growth
has each of us seen this fig-tree?” The elephant said: “When I came this way with
our herd I saw this tree of the size of my body.” The monkey said: “When I came this
way with our troop, I saw that its size was the same as my own.” Then said the animals:
“You are older than the elephant.” The hare said: “When the tree had only two leaves,
I licked the dew-drops off them <span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>with my tongue.” Then the animals said: “You are older than both the others.” The
partridge said: “So ye have seen the fig-tree when it was of a certain size?” They
said that they had. “But I,” it continued, “having eaten seed, let fall that from
which this tree has sprung.” The animals said: “If that is so, you are the oldest
among us.” Thereupon the elephant began to pay honour to all the others, and the monkey
to the hare and the partridge, and the hare to the partridge. In this way they showed
each other reverence according to their respective ages.
</p>
<p>In the dense forest they were wont to wander to and fro, and when they came to open
spaces and broken ground, the monkey used to ride on the elephant, and the hare on
the monkey, and the partridge on the hare. Now when their feelings of mutual attachment
and reverence had still more increased, there occurred to them this thought, that
as their attachment and reverence had increased, they ought to strive a little after
other virtues as well. In reply to the question as to what was to be done, the partridge
said, “One should abstain from putting living creatures to death.” The other said,
“What like are those among us who put living creatures to death?”
</p>
<p>The partridge replied, “There are leaves, flowers, and fruits, which are endowed with
life, as well as those which are devoid of it. In future we will enjoy those which
are lifeless, giving up those which possess life.” So they took to giving up what
possessed life, and partaking of what was lifeless. Then they thought, “Since we have
renounced the putting to death of what is living, but not as yet the acquisition of
the unbestowed, therefore will we also renounce the acquisition of the unobtained.”
“What like are those among us who acquire the unbestowed?” said the others. The partridge
said, “There are in our possession, roots, leaves, flowers, and fruits, but there
are also such as are unpossessed; therefore will we in future give up those which
we possess, and feed only on the <span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>unpossessed.” So they took to giving up what was possessed, and feeding on the previously
unpossessed.
</p>
<p>Then they thought, “We have now renounced the acquisition of the unbestowed, but not
as yet illicit intercourse.” “In what does our illicit intercourse consist?” The partridge
said, “As we enter into allowable unions and also unallowable, we must henceforth
enter into allowable unions alone, and not unallowable.” So they followed the lawful
paths and gave up those which were unlawful. Then they thought, “We have now renounced
unlawful love, but not as yet falsehood. Well, we will also renounce falsehood.” “Wherein
then consists our falsehood?” asked the others. The partridge said, “Whereas we have
been in the habit of speaking all at random, we will in future speak at random no
more, but will utter only well-considered words at the right time.” So they no longer
spoke at random, but uttered merely well-considered words at the right time. Then
they thought, “We have renounced falsehood, but not as yet shameless intoxication,
by means of intoxicating drinks. Well, we will also renounce shameless intoxication
by means of intoxicating drinks.” “What like are those among us who shamelessly intoxicate
themselves with intoxicating drinks?” The partridge said, “As there are fruits which
intoxicate, and also such as do not, we will in future, giving up the intoxicating
fruits, partake of those only which are not intoxicating.” So they began to partake
of only the non-intoxicating fruits, giving up those which intoxicate.
</p>
<p>Now when they were duly set fast in the five vows, the partridge said, “O honoured
ones, as we are now duly set fast in the five vows, we will confirm others also in
the five vows.” The others said, “We will do so. But whom shall each of us confirm
in them?” The monkey said, “I will confirm all monkeys therein.” Then said the hare,
“I will confirm therein all hares and furry beasts.” The elephant said, “This being
the case, I will <span class="pageNum" id="pb305">[<a href="#pb305">305</a>]</span>confirm therein all elephants, lions, tigers, and bears.” The partridge said, “This
being the case, I will also now confirm in the five vows all the as yet unconverted
birds and creatures, footless, two-footed, and four-footed.” Then they confirmed in
the five vows all the living creatures of the animal world, as many as there were
of them in the Kāśi land.
</p>
<p>As they did each other no harm, and lived in the dense forest according to their knowledge
and pleasure, their influence brought it about that the deity sent rain from time
to time, and the earth was constantly provided with seeds, flowers, and fruit-trees.
</p>
<p>Now, when the king saw that men were living without doing each other any harm, and
that the earth was constantly provided with seeds, flowers, and fruit-trees, he said,
“As I rule according to law, this is due to my influence.” His wives, and the princes,
ministers, warriors, towns-people, and country-folk, were of opinion that it was due
to their influence. When the king perceived that they all considered it as due to
their influence he was astonished, and he sent for the diviners and asked about it,
but they knew nothing of the matter.
</p>
<p>Not far from Vārāṇasī there was a grove in which there dwelt a Rishi, endowed with
the five kinds of higher knowledge. He practised divination for the men who dwelt
in Vārāṇasī and paid honour to him. To this Rishi the king betook himself, touching
his feet and saying, “O great Rishi, as all the living beings in my realm belonging
to the animal world, without doing one another any harm, live according to their knowledge
and pleasure, and the deity sends rain at the right season, and the earth is constantly
provided with seeds, flowers, and fruit-trees, therefore I have supposed that, as
I rule according to the law, this is due to my power. But as my wives, and the princes,
ministers, warriors, towns-people, and country-folk, are of opinion that it is all
due to their power, I am greatly puzzled. Therefore it is meet that you should dispel
the doubt as to whose power it is due.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Rishi replied, “O great king, it is not your power which has brought this about,
nor yet that of your wives, princes, ministers, warriors, towns-people, or country-folk.
But there are four living creatures in your realm whose power has done so.” The king
said, “If this be so, I will go to see them.” The Rishi said, “Wherefore do you wish
to see them? Rather adopt the course of life which they have adopted, and live according
to it.”
</p>
<p>“What course of life have they adopted?”
</p>
<p>“That of the five vows.”
</p>
<p>“O great Rishi, what is the nature of these five vows?”
</p>
<p>“O great king, they are these: Not to take the life of any living creature; not to
steal the property of others; not to enter into unlawful unions; not to lie; not to
drink intoxicating liquors.”
</p>
<p>“O great Rishi,” said the king, “if this be so, I also will observe these five vows,
and live in accordance with them.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the king began to observe those five vows, and to behave accordingly. As
the king observed the five vows, and lived in accordance with them, his wives did
the same, and the princes, ministers, warriors, towns-people, and country-folk, accepted
the five vows, and took to behaving in conformity with them. When the tributary kings
heard that King Brahmadatta, together with his wives, princes, ministers, warriors,
towns-people, and country-folk, had undertaken the five vows, and were living in conformity
with them, they also, along with their wives, princes, ministers, warriors, towns-people,
and country-folk, accepted the five vows and observed them. The greater part of the
inhabitants of Jambudvīpa accepted the five vows, and began to observe them. Whosoever
then died in Jambudvīpa, after his body perished, was born again in the Tushita region
of the thirty-three gods.
</p>
<p>When the king of the gods, Śakra, saw the circle of the gods so enlarged, he uttered
this verse—
</p>
<p>“The partridge’s disciples, dwelling in the penance-forest <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>with esteem and reverence, have instructed the world in the doctrine.”
</p>

<p>Bhagavant said, “O Bhikshus, what think ye? I myself was the partridge of that period,

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A very long time ago, it once rained unseasonably seven days long, and an ichneumon
took refuge in a mouse-hole. Into the same hole came, after wandering to and fro,
a snake, alarmed by the rain. Now the ichneumon was preparing to kill the mouse, but
the snake said, “O honoured ones, as we have all suffered from the agony of intolerable
woe, therefore we ought to remain here without exposing each other to danger and free
from disturbance.” The snake was named Nandasena, the ichneumon Nanda, and the mouse
Gaṇgādatta.
</p>
<p>Nandasena and Nanda said to Gaṇgādatta, “Go stealthily, and try to find some food
for us.” As the mouse was honest and well-disposed, it zealously began to look for
food for those two, but could not find any. Nanda said to Nandasena, “If Gaṇgādatta
comes back without food, I shall eat Gaṇgādatta.” But Nandasena thought, “Even during
the anguish of intolerable woe did this ichneumon intend to kill that mouse; there
is no need to say, then, what will happen if the mouse returns without bringing food.
I had better give it notice beforehand.”
</p>
<p>So the snake informed the mouse, saying, “Nanda has spoken thus: ‘If Gaṇgādatta comes
back without bringing food, I will eat Gaṇgādatta.’ ” Gaṇgādatta, who, after seeking
for food, had found none, thought, “Without doubt he will devour me,” and said to
Nandasena, “As one who is weakened and oppressed by hunger becomes merciless, therefore
say to the ungrateful creature that Gaṇgādatta will return no more.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long past times King Brahmadatta came to the throne in Vārāṇasī. A man, who had
gone with his axe and wood-basket into the forest to fetch wood, was frightened by
a lion while looking for wood, and in running away fell into a pit. Into it fell likewise
the lion which was intending to devour him. A mouse, which had been frightened by
a snake, ran away from it, and a falcon pursued the mouse, in order to devour it.
They all four fell into the pit, and they all entertained the evil design of putting
each other to death. But the lion said, “O honoured ones, ye are all comrades of mine.
As things are so, and we are suffering intolerable pain from woe, it is now no time
for us to expose one another to danger. Therefore sit quietly without disturbing yourselves.”
</p>
<p>By the dispensation of destiny a hunter, who was looking for gazelles, came to that
spot, and while he was looking at that pit, all those creatures exclaimed in confused
words, “Ho, friend, rescue us!” Understanding what they said, the hunter drew out
first of all the lion. It touched his feet and said, “I shall prove grateful to you.
But do not draw out that black-headed one who forgets accepted benefits.” Having thus
spoken, the lion departed. The hunter then proceeded to extricate them all by degrees
from the pit.
</p>
<p>One day the hunter came again to that spot when the lion had killed a gazelle. The
lion recognised the man, <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>and touched his feet, and gave him the gazelle. At another time King Brahmadatta had
gone into the park with his spouse, and, after enjoying himself there, had lain down
to sleep. Left at their ease, the women took off their clothes and exposed them to
the air. And they laid aside their ornaments in divers places and roamed about, or
sat, reposed, and slept in the grove. When one of the wives had laid aside her ornaments
at a certain spot, and had gone to sleep, the falcon carried them off, and gratefully
presented them to the hunter. When the king awoke from his sleep he went swiftly to
Vārāṇasī. And away went quickly also the wives, princes, ministers, towns-people,
and country-folk. The wife, who looked for her ornaments but could not find them,
said to the king, “O king, my ornaments are lost in the park.” The king gave orders
to his ministers, saying, “O honoured ones, as the ornaments are lost, find out who
has carried them off.”
</p>
<p>When they began to make inquiries, the black-headed man, who had visited the hunter
from time to time and knew that he was in possession of the ornaments, came with ungrateful
heart and told the king. Then the king was very angry. And the king’s men summoned
the hunter, and said to him, “Ho, friend, you stole the ornaments out of the park.”
The hunter was terrified and related what had taken place. The ornaments were restored
to the king. But the hunter was bound and cast into prison.
</p>
<p>Then the mouse went to the snake and said, “By the contrivance of the black-headed
sinner has our benefactor been bound and cast into prison.” The snake said, “O hunter,
I will bite the king to-day. Then do you heal him with this spell and this remedy.
If that is done, no doubt the king will set you at liberty, and will confer upon you
gifts and good things.” The hunter said, “Good, so be it!” The snake bit the king,
and the hunter came and healed him with the spell and the remedy. Then the king joyfully
released him from the prison, and bestowed upon him gifts and good things.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long past times the Bodisat, his accumulations<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4877src" href="#xd31e4877">2</a> as yet incomplete, was born again among birds as a woodpecker, dwelling in a villageless
solitude in a hill district, rich in mountain streams, fruits, and flowers. In the
same district there lived a king of the beasts, a lion, which was in the habit of
killing and devouring gazelles at its pleasure. One day it had been eating meat; a
bone stuck fast between its teeth, and the lion, which had never known fear or anxiety,
now that toothache was plaguing its body, was quite prostrated and could eat nothing.
</p>
<p>By good fortune a woodpecker, which was wont to fly from one tree-top to another,
came to the place where the king of the beasts was. When it saw the lion so tormented
by pain, it said, “Uncle, wherefore are you cast down?” The lion replied, “Nephew,
I am tortured by pain.” “What sort of pain?” asked the woodpecker. When the lion had
told the whole story, the woodpecker said, “Uncle, I will treat your case. As you
are the lion and the king of all four-footed beasts, and can be of service, therefore
you must from time to time be of service to me.” The lion replied, “I will act in
accordance with your words.”
</p>
<p>The woodpecker thought, “I will manage so that the lion shall not perceive what I
am doing to it, and shall <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>find it out only after recovering.” Anxious to assist the lion, the woodpecker remained
there observing its way of going on. The violence of the pain having abated, the king
of the beasts passed into a happier mood, and went to sleep with its jaws apart on
a great, broad, flat rock. The woodpecker drew near to the king of the beasts, and
thought that, as it found the lion in so convenient a position, this was the proper
moment for treating it. After making a careful examination, the woodpecker, by means
of a continued fluttering of its wings, extracted the bone which had stuck between
the lion’s teeth. And the lion sat up, with eyes opening after surmounted slumber.
Then the woodpecker, knowing that the king of the beasts was freed from pain and discomfort,
came up to it in high glee, and said, “O uncle, here is the bone which caused the
pain.” The king of the beasts was greatly astonished and said, “O nephew, as I wish
to recompense you for this service, come to me from time to time in order that I may
be of use to you.” The woodpecker replied, “Good, I will do so,” and flew away.
</p>
<p>At another time, while the king of the beasts was devouring flesh, the woodpecker,
which had been seized by a falcon, and had only just escaped from death, appeared
before the king of the beasts in a state of suffering from hunger. Having described
its need, it said to the lion, “O uncle, I am tormented with hunger, so give me a
piece of flesh.” The lion replied in a verse—
</p>
<p>“Having torn to pieces a living creature, I am now savage and a misdoer. Are not you,
who passed between my teeth, thankful for remaining alive?”
</p>
<p>The woodpecker answered likewise in verse—
</p>
<p>“Profitless are forms seen in dreams and accumulations flung into the ocean. Profitless
are intercourse with a bad man, and benefits conferred on the ungrateful.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there lived a herd of elephants in a certain district. One of their number
fell in love with a female elephant. But she was warmly attached to another young
male elephant, to whom she said, “Should not we take to flight when he goes forth
to the chase?”
</p>
<p>“Is there any means by which we may escape?” asked the young elephant.
</p>
<p>“I know of a means,” she replied.
</p>
<p>Then she said to the other elephant, “Let us go into the pool to bathe.”
</p>
<p>He went into the pool. Then she said, “Let us see which of us two can remain under
water the longest.”
</p>
<p>As soon as he, who was liberally endowed with stupidity, had gone under water along
with her, she emerged and fled away together with the young elephant. When the other
elephant had remained a long time under water, he also emerged. But as the female
elephant was not to be seen, he thought that he was in danger of being surpassed by
her, so he determined to go under water again. When he had gone again under water,
he propped himself up at the bottom with his tusks.
</p>
<p>When, after some time, being out of breath, he lifted his head out of the water and
saw that the female elephant was not there, he took to tramping about wildly in the
tank, and thereby inflicted unjustifiable injury on fishes, frogs, tortoises, and
many other creatures. Then a deity uttered this verse—
</p>
<p>“What a huge lump of flesh devoid of intelligence! Because another has carried off
the female, therefore he inflicts injury upon others.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long past times there lived a householder in a certain hill-village. His shepherd
went afield to tend his flocks. As the shepherd returned to the village at sunset
from tending them, an old ewe which lagged somewhat behind was seized by a wolf.
</p>
<p>“Aunt, aunt,” said the wolf, “is it well with you? Aunt, aunt, do you seem to find
yourself comfortable all alone in the forest?”
</p>
<p>Moreover the wolf said, “Do you think, O sheep, whom I have addressed by the name
of aunt, that you will escape after having pinched my tail, and also plucked hairs
out of my tail?”
</p>
<p>The sheep replied, “How could I pinch your tail, seeing that it is behind you, and
I have been going in front of you?”
</p>
<p>But the wolf said, “Which way then did you come, seeing that my tail spreads all over
the four parts of the world, together with the ocean and the hill-villages?”
</p>
<p>The sheep rejoined: “As I had heard beforehand from my kinsmen that your tail, O best
one, spreads everywhere, I came through the air.”
</p>
<p>The wolf replied, “O mother, if you came through the air, you must have scared away
the herd of gazelles which I meant to feed upon.”
</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, the malefactor made a spring, tore off the sheep’s head, and having
killed the sheep, devoured its flesh.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain hill district there lived a householder, to whom, after his marriage,
a daughter was born. He was a tiller of the soil, and ploughed his corn-field himself.
</p>
<p>The orphan son of a householder, who was bringing a load of wood from the forest,
happened to draw near to that corn-field one day. And he threw down the wood he was
carrying, rested awhile, and then said, “O uncle, why do you plough yourself? You
must certainly have village affairs to look after. Why, then, do you work like a forester
in the forest?”
</p>
<p>“O nephew, I have neither sons nor brothers.”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, give me the plough. Do you take rest, and I will plough for you.”
</p>
<p>With these words he began to plough.
</p>
<p>After a time the householder came bringing rice-soup, and invited him to eat. When
the meal was finished the householder’s son said, “O uncle, I do not know your house.
Go away now, and I will continue ploughing; but come to meet me in the evening.”
</p>
<p>The householder went away, and the youth went on ploughing for a time. Then he turned
out the two oxen to graze by the side of the corn-field. In the evening he took a
load of grass, and set off to go to the village. The householder came to meet him,
and brought him to his house. The youth took the oxen to their stall, shook down straw,
and placed grass before them. The householder thought that the youth would be useful
to him, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb316">[<a href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>that he would give him his daughter to wife. So he said to him, “O nephew, do everything
satisfactorily, and I will give you my daughter to wife.”
</p>
<p>He began to build a house there. One of his oxen ran into a rice-field, and he could
not drive it out, so he reviled it, and then flung a log at it, whereby one of its
horns was broken off. In consequence of this, the ox received the name of Hornbreak.
</p>
<p>Another time, the ox ran again into the field, and he could not drive it back, so
he reviled it, and then flung a sickle at it, whereby its tail was cut off; on account
of which it received the name of Stumptail. These two names were afterwards contracted
into that of Breakstump.
</p>
<p>After some time the youth said to the householder, “Uncle, fulfil what you have promised.”
The householder said to his wife, “Good wife, make all the preparations for a wedding.
I am going to give my daughter in marriage.” The wife said, “O lord, as our daughter
has not been promised to any one, how can she be given in marriage?”
</p>
<p>He replied, “I shall give her in marriage.”
</p>
<p>“To whom?”
</p>
<p>“To this householder’s son.”
</p>
<p>The wife said, “Shall I give my daughter in marriage to this fortuneless one, forsooth,
who has grown up like white pepper? I shall marry her there where I find food and
clothing.”
</p>
<p>The husband rejoined, “Good wife, the youth has done me excellent service. If he goes
away, I shall be obliged to plough my land myself.”
</p>
<p>The wife replied, “I cannot give my daughter to this paltry fellow.”
</p>
<p>Then the householder said to himself, “If I tell the youth that I am not going to
give him my daughter, he will go away this very day, and I shall be reduced to great
straits.” So he tried putting him off from time to time. When the youth again called
upon him to fulfil his promise he replied, “O nephew, first of all make an end of
<span class="pageNum" id="pb317">[<a href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>the rice-harvest, for I shall have to prepare rice-soup for a very large circle of
relatives.”
</p>
<p>When that was done, the youth called upon him to celebrate the wedding. The householder
replied, “O nephew, as sugar-cane will be wanted, first of all make an end of the
sugar-cane harvest.”
</p>
<p>The youth did so, and then renewed his demand. The householder said, “O nephew, as
bread will be needed, first of all make an end of the wheat-harvest.”
</p>
<p>The youth did so, and anew demanded the fulfilment of the promise. The householder
said, “As the early rice has come to an end, make preparations for one more harvest.”
</p>
<p>The youth thought, “As these things cannot be done at that time, and he is playing
with me, I will go into one of the great assemblies of the people, and compel him
to give me an answer. If he will not give me his daughter, I will bring it about so
that I shall receive her in a friendly way out of the king’s palace.”
</p>
<p>So he went into a large assembly of the people, and said, “O uncle, celebrate the
wedding.” The householder reviled him, and said, “O friends, I certainly will not
give my daughter to this man, who works for me as a day-labourer.” The young man thought,
“As I have received from him neither money nor his daughter, I will do him some small
injury and then go away.”
</p>
<p>After ploughing with the oxen all day he beat them with the goad, fastened them to
a dry tree in the sun, and then went away.<span id="xd31e4970"></span>
</p>
<p>Now it was part of the nature of things, not long after the creation of the world,
that even brute beasts could speak. And so the two oxen said to him, “O man, you have
constantly been for us, as it were, a father and a mother, and have always treated
us with kindness. Why have you now beaten us with the goad, after ploughing with us
through the day, and why are you going away, after fastening us to a dry tree in the
sun? O man, have we wronged you in any way?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Ye have not wronged me in the least, but your master has wronged me.”
</p>
<p>“In what way?”
</p>
<p>“He promised me his daughter, but he has not given her to me.”
</p>
<p>“Why do not you go to the palace of the king?”
</p>
<p>“I have no witnesses.”
</p>
<p>“You just go; we will be witnesses.”
</p>
<p>“Will ye speak with the language of men?”
</p>
<p>“No. But this is how you must make your asseveration. You must tie us up in our stalls
for seven days, and give us neither grass nor water; and on the seventh day you must
let us go free to a spot where grass and water are plentiful. And you must appear
before the king, and say to him, ‘If I am speaking the truth, may these oxen neither
eat grass nor drink water.’ ”
</p>
<p>The householder’s son went to the palace of the king, and said, “O king, that proprietor
has promised me his daughter, but he has not yet given her to me to wife.”
</p>
<p>The king said, “Have you any witnesses?”
</p>
<p>“Yes, O king.”
</p>
<p>“Are they human beings or not?”
</p>
<p>“No, they are not human beings, but oxen.”
</p>
<p>“Can they speak the language of men?”
</p>
<p>“No, but my words will in this way be proved to be true. I will tie up these oxen
in their stalls during seven days, and leave them without grass or water. But on the
seventh day I will let them go free to a place where grass and water are plentiful.
Then the oxen, in order to prove the truth of my words, will neither eat grass nor
drink water so long as the king refuses to believe me.”
</p>
<p>The king said to his ministers, “O honoured ones, let the matter be so arranged.”
</p>
<p>The ministers ordered the oxen to be tied up in their stalls. Breakstump asked, “Does
the sun rise in the West? why are not we set free?”
</p>
<p>The others said, “We have promised the householder’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>son, that if he keeps us tied up in our stall, for seven days without giving us grass
and water, and lets us go free on the seventh day in a spot which is rich in grass
and water, and if he makes asseveration before the king that if he speaks the truth
these oxen will neither eat grass nor drink water, then we will neither eat grass
nor drink water so long as the king refuses to believe him.”
</p>
<p>Breakstump said, “If I were set free I should eat even stones, not to speak of grass.”
</p>
<p>The oxen said, “The householder’s son has always acted towards us like a father and
a mother. So do not behave in that manner.”
</p>
<p>Breakstump said, “It is indeed true that he has behaved towards us like a father and
a mother; still, as he has given me the name of Breakstump, I will not consent, but
would much rather that his belly should burst.”
</p>
<p>The householder’s son visited the oxen from time to time, and asked, “O oxen, how
do ye fare?” They replied, “We fare well, but you do not.”
</p>
<p>“Why not?”
</p>
<p>“Breakstump here has declared that if he be let loose he will devour the very stones,
not to speak of grass.”
</p>
<p>“Then ought I to give in?”
</p>
<p>“Do not do that, but bore Breakstump’s nose. Then, when he wants to eat grass or drink
water, we will seize his nose with our horns and hold it up in the air. At the same
time you must say, ‘They are pointing to the sun, because they wish to show that the
sun, as the fifth guardian of the world, is a witness.’ ”
</p>
<p>So the youth set to work to bore the nose of the ox. Breakstump said, “Honoured ones,
see how scandalously he is treating me!” They replied, “Hold your peace, he wishes
to embellish you.”
</p>
<p>On the seventh day the king, after calling his ministers together, had these oxen
driven to a spot rich in grass and water. Breakstump was about to pluck a mouthful
of grass, when the other oxen seized his nose with their <span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>horns and looked up towards the sun. The king asked his ministers, “O honoured ones,
wherefore look these oxen towards the sun?” Then one of the ministers said, “That
is done because they wish to show that not they alone are witnesses, but the sun,
the fifth guardian of the world, is also a witness.” The king wondered and said to
the ministers, “O honoured ones, as the beasts have thus borne witness, do ye take
care that the householder gives his daughter to this young man.”
</p>
<p>Overcome by the householder-son, the householder bestowed upon him his daughter.

<p class="first">Long ago two merchants, with five hundred waggons apiece, were journeying along a
forest road, where at one time there was too little grass, at another too little water,
and sometimes there was nothing at all to be had. So when the merchants, who, as well
as their oxen, were in a state of great exhaustion, saw from the forest road a region
in which meadows and water were plentiful, they unharnessed their oxen, and they bathed
and drank much water. Now when the oxen, which had been greatly exhausted by the want
of grass and water, had drunk water and eaten their fill of grass and recovered their
strength, the leading one among the first set said to its comrades, “O honoured ones,
as we have been completely exhausted by the want of grass and water, and this place
is full of water and pasture, if ye are so inclined, we will remain here.”
</p>
<p>But the leading ox of the other troop spoke to them in this wise, “O honoured ones,
as men are strong and have the mastery over even the difficult to be subdued, and
we should only suffer damage at their hands, let us endure the burden which shall
be laid upon us.”
</p>
<p>When it had thus spoken, the first chief ox said angrily to its troop, “O honoured
ones, who has seen the further side of the moon? Let those oxen submit to their burden.
We will not endure ours.”
</p>
<p>So when the merchants began to load their oxen, and the first set of animals held
stubbornly back, the merchants <span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>beat them and lacerated them with thorny rods, and yoked them dripping with blood
to the waggons. But the others submitted to the yoke without resisting, so no harm
came to them. Thereupon a deity uttered this śloka:
</p>
<p>“See how the steers which the ox misguided, bleeding and wounded, suffer hunger and
thirst. See how those which the ox rightly advised, after leaving the forest, quaff
cooling water.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When in long-past times the Bodisat, in consequence of his aggregation of merits remaining
incomplete, had been born in a herd of horned cattle as a bull, he used to go out
of the city in the evenings to a bean-field belonging to the king, and there take
his food. But by day he lived in the city. There an ass joined him. It said one day,
“O uncle, your flesh and your blood and your hide thrive, and yet I have never seen
you change your abode.”
</p>
<p>The bull answered, “O nephew, I feed at eventide in the king’s bean-field.”
</p>
<p>The ass said, “Uncle, I will go with you too.”
</p>
<p>The bull objected, “O nephew, as you are wont to let your voice resound, we might
run a risk.”
</p>
<p>The ass replied, “O uncle, let us go, I will not raise my voice.”
</p>
<p>After they two had broken through the enclosure of the bean-field and reached the
interior, the ass uttered no sound until it had eaten its fill. Then it said, “Uncle,
shall not I sing a little?”
</p>
<p>The bull replied, “Wait an instant, until I have gone away. Then do just as you please.”
</p>
<p>The bull ran off, and the ass lifted up its voice. As soon as the king’s people heard
that, they seized the ass, and in order to punish it, as in their opinion it had devoured
the whole produce of the king’s bean-field, they cut off its ears, fastened a pestle
to its neck, and then set it free. <span class="pageNum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>As it wandered to and fro, the bull saw it, and pronounced this verse—
</p>
<p>“Excellently hast thou sung forsooth, and therefore obtained thy recompense. In consequence
of thy song I also well-nigh lost my ears.
</p>
<p>“He who knows not how to keep his word, to him may easily happen some such thing as
this; to wander to and fro, adorned with a club and destitute of ears.”
</p>
<p>The ass also gave utterance to a verse, “Keep silence thou with broken teeth, be silent
then, O old bull; for three men are searching for thee with clubs in their hands.”

<p class="first">In long-past times there lived in a certain forest a pregnant lioness. Now it is the
custom of lionesses to lay up stores of flesh for the time when they shall bring forth
their young. The lioness, having followed after a herd of cattle, struck down a cow
which had calved, and which, while taking care of her calf, lagged behind the rest
of the herd. The lioness killed the cow, and dragged it off to her lair; the calf,
which wanted to suck her mother’s teats, following after her. The lioness was at first
inclined to kill the calf too, but reflected that it would serve as a playfellow for
her cub so soon as she brought it into the world. She gave birth to a male cub, which
she suckled along with the calf.
</p>
<p>After they had both grown up, the lioness fell ill, and before her death spoke thus,
“O children, as ye have both sucked the same dugs, behave as brothers. The world is
full of evil calumniators. Take heed, when I am dead, that ye do not listen to such
persons.”
</p>
<p>The lion, which ate the good flesh of the gazelles he killed, and drank his fill of
their blood, grew big; and so did the bull, which fed on the good grass guarded by
the lion, and enjoyed clear water. The lion, as the king of <span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>beasts, was followed about by an old, very greedy, remainder-devouring jackal. When
the lion had killed gazelles, and having devoured their good flesh and drunk their
good blood, tranquilly rested, none of the rest of the smaller beasts dared to draw
nigh. Only the old jackal used to approach, in order to enjoy what remained over of
the good flesh and blood, thanks to which his hide, his flesh, and his blood all thrived.
</p>
<p>One day, when the lion had eaten the good flesh of gazelles and drunk their good blood,
he hastened to his lair, where he played with the bull. In the meantime the smaller
beasts devoured the remains. The jackal thought, “First, I will go to see whither
the lion has gone.” Having followed after the lion, the jackal saw him playing together
with the bull, and came to the conclusion that the bull was the adversary of his maw,
and that therefore he must set those two comrades at variance. So with drooping ears
he appeared before the bull. The bull said, “O uncle, has any hot wind arisen?”
</p>
<p>The jackal replied, “O nephew, a very glowing wind has arisen.”
</p>
<p>“What is it then that has happened?”
</p>
<p>“The lion has asked, ‘Whither has gone the bull which belongs to my stores of flesh?
If I find no other flesh, I shall devour that bull.’ ”
</p>
<p>The bull replied, “O uncle, our dying mother said to us twain, ‘O children, as ye
have both sucked the same dugs, be brothers. The world is full of evil calumniators.
Take heed that ye listen to none of them after my death.’ As she has left behind her
such a legacy as this, do not talk in that way.”
</p>
<p>The jackal said, “O nephew, as you will not listen to my well-meant words, you will
go to perdition.”
</p>
<p>The bull asked, “O uncle, what then will be the course of events?”
</p>
<p>The jackal replied, “O nephew, the lion will come forth from his lair, and will stretch
himself, and after he <span class="pageNum" id="pb327">[<a href="#pb327">327</a>]</span>has stretched himself he will yawn, and after he has yawned he will look round on
all four sides, and after he has looked round on all four sides, he will roar three
times, and when he has come to where you are, he will think, ‘This creature will kill
me;’ be sure of that.”
</p>
<p>Afterwards the jackal betook himself with drooping ears to the lion. The lion asked,
“Uncle, has a hot wind arisen?”
</p>
<p>The jackal replied, “O nephew, a very glowing wind has arisen.”
</p>
<p>“What has happened then?”
</p>
<p>“The bull has said, ‘Whither has my lion-grass gone? As his mother killed my mother,
I will slit up his belly.’ ”
</p>
<p>The lion said, “O uncle, our mother, before she died, thus spoke to us twain, ‘As
ye two have sucked the same dugs, be brothers. The world is full of evil calumniators.
Take heed that ye do not listen to any of them.’ As she has left such a legacy behind,
do not speak in such a manner.”
</p>
<p>The jackal replied, “O nephew, if you do not now listen to my well-meant words, you
will go to perdition.”
</p>
<p>The lion said, “O uncle, what will take place?”
</p>
<p>The jackal replied, “O nephew, the bull will come forth from the meadow, and will
stretch himself, and when he has stretched himself he will bellow, and when he has
bellowed he will tear up the ground, and when he has torn up the ground he will come
snorting into your presence and will think, ‘This one will kill me;’ know all this.”
</p>
<p>Although those two animals were constantly in the habit of acting in this way according
to their natures, they had never taken any notice of the fact. So when one day after
this the lion, the king of beasts, came forth from his lair, after stretching and
yawning and looking around on all four sides, and roaring three times, he appeared
in presence of the bull. Likewise the bull had come out from the pen, and had stretched
himself, and bellowed, and torn up the ground and snorted, and then it appeared in
presence of the lion. Although they had both been <span class="pageNum" id="pb328">[<a href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>accustomed to act in this way according to their natures, they had never taken any
notice of the fact. But they noticed it now that the seed of discord was sown. The
bull thought, “He will kill me,” and the lion thought just the same. The lion seized
the bull’s breast with his claws, the bull slit up the lion’s belly with his horns.
And so they both perished.
</p>
<p>A deity uttered the following verse: “Men who pay regard to what is good, ought not
to hold converse with bad men. See how the jackal set at variance the lion and the
bull who had been friends.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long-past times there lived in a forest a lioness with her cub and a tigress with
her cub. While the lioness was absent one day, her cub, while wandering about, came
into the neighbourhood of the tigress. When the tigress saw it, she was going to kill
it, but she changed her mind, seeing that the young lion might be a playfellow for
her own cub, and so she began to give it suck. The lioness, on her return from her
outing, not finding her young one, set to work to look for it, and at length saw the
tigress suckling it. When the tigress perceived the lioness, she was frightened and
began to run away. But the lioness cried out to the tigress, “O sister, run not away.
Let us dwell together, so that, when I go out, you can take care of my young one,
and when you go out, I will take care of yours.” So they took to dwelling together,
and they called the lion cub Sudaṇshṭhra, and the tiger cub Subāhu. And the two cubs
grew up.
</p>
<p>After a time the lioness and the tigress fell ill, and when the time for their departure
came, they said to the two young beasts, “O children, as ye have both sucked the same
dugs, be ye brothers. The world is full of evil calumniators, take heed after our
death not to listen to any of them.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now the young lion was wont to kill gazelles, and to devour their good flesh and lap
their good blood, and then, having done this, to betake himself at once to his lair.
But the young tiger, when he went out, underwent great fatigue in killing gazelles,
and having devoured their flesh and lapped their blood, returned home after a long
absence. One day the tiger devoured the remains of a meal which he had hidden away,
and then returned quickly home. The lion asked, “How is it that you, who never came
back before till after a long time, have returned to-day so soon?” The tiger replied,
“I have eaten the stores which I had set aside.” The lion asked, “Do you lay up stores,
then?” The tiger said that it did. The lion said, “When I have slain gazelles and
eaten their good flesh and lapped their good blood, I am wont to go away without troubling
myself further.” The tiger replied, “You are strong. I cannot do like that.” The lion
said, “Let us go together.” So they took to going out together.
</p>
<p>Now an old, very malicious, remainder-devouring jackal, was in the habit of following
after this lion, the king of the beasts. The jackal considered that the tiger was
the antagonist of his maw, and that he must set those two animals at variance. So
he came into the presence of the lion with drooping ears. The lion said, “O uncle,
has any hot wind arisen?”
</p>
<p>The jackal replied, “O nephew, a very scorching wind has arisen.”
</p>
<p>“What has happened then?”
</p>
<p>“This tiger has said, ‘Where has my lion-grass gone? As he leaves me to feed on remnants,
I will assuredly kill him.’ ”
</p>
<p>The lion replied, “O uncle, our two mothers said to us just before they died, ‘O children,
as ye two have sucked the same dugs, be brothers. The world is full of evil calumniators.
Take heed that after we are both dead, ye do not listen to any one among them.’ As
they have left such a legacy behind them, do not you speak in that way.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb330">[<a href="#pb330">330</a>]</span></p>
<p>The jackal said, “As you will not listen to my well-meant words, you will come to
ruin.”
</p>
<p>The lion said, “O uncle, what will be the course of events?”
</p>
<p>The jackal replied, “O nephew, the tiger will come forth from his lair, and will stretch
himself, and after stretching he will yawn, and after yawning he will look round on
all four sides, and after looking round on all four sides he will roar three times,
and then come into your presence and think, ‘He will kill me.’ Be sure of this.”
</p>
<p>Afterwards the jackal went with drooping ears to the tiger. The tiger asked, “O uncle,
has some hot wind arisen?”
</p>
<p>The jackal replied, “O nephew, a very scorching wind has arisen.”
</p>
<p>“What has happened then?”
</p>
<p>“This lion has said, ‘Where has my tiger-grass gone? I will assuredly kill him.’ ”
</p>
<p>The tiger said, “O uncle, our two mothers said to us, just before they died, ‘O children,
as ye have sucked the same breast, be brothers. The world is full of evil calumniators.
Take heed that ye do not listen to any of them. As they have left us this legacy,
do not you speak in that way.<span class="corr" id="xd31e5132" title="Not in source">’</span>”
</p>
<p>The jackal replied, “O nephew, as you will not listen to my well-meant words, you
will go to ruin.”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, what then will be the course of events?”
</p>
<p>“O nephew, this lion will come forth from his lair and will stretch himself, and after
stretching he will yawn, and after yawning he will look round on all four sides, and
after looking round on all four sides, he will roar three times, and then come into
your presence, and think, ‘He will kill me.’ Be sure of all this.”
</p>
<p>Now although both of them were in the habit of acting in this way, according to their
natures, they had never taken any notice of that. But one day the lion, the king <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>of beasts, came forth from his lair and stretched himself, and yawned, and looked
round on all four sides, and roared three times, and then went into the presence of
the tiger. The tiger also came forth from his lair, and stretched himself and yawned,
and looked round on all four sides, and then went into the presence of the lion. Although
both of them had always been in the habit of doing all this, yet they had never taken
any notice of the fact. But now that the seed of discord was sown, they did notice
it. Just as the lion thought that the tiger wanted to kill him, so also the tiger
thought that the lion wanted to kill him. But then the lion thought, “I am strong,
but the tiger is not. As he cannot then master me, I will investigate the matter further.”
So he uttered this śloka—
</p>
<p>“O Subāhu, to strive with Sudaṇshṭhra, possessor of complete excellence, agility,
and force, is not right.”
</p>
<p>The tiger also replied in a śloka, “O Sudaṇshṭhra, to strive with Subāhu, possessor
of complete excellence, agility, and force, is not right.”
</p>
<p>The lion asked, “Who spoke to you about this?”
</p>
<p>The tiger replied, “The jackal.”
</p>
<p>Then the tiger asked, “Who spoke to you about this?”
</p>
<p>The lion replied, “The jackal.”
</p>
<p>Then the lion thought, “This creature wanted to set us two at variance,” and struck
the jackal dead with a slap in the face. Then a deity uttered this śloka—
</p>
<p>“Friends ought not to be abandoned on account of the words of others, but the words
of others ought to be tested. No reliance ought to be placed upon calumniators, who
seek opportunities for sowing discord. See how the jackal, who desired to set friends
at variance by means of lies, was put to death as a calumniator, while the friends
were happy and rejoiced.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long-past times there lived on the bank of a river two otters, which from time
to time used to enter the water and bring fish ashore. But while the otters were on
the dry land, the fish used to get back into the water.
</p>
<p>Finding there was nothing left, the otters took counsel together one day, and determined
that in future one of them should go into the water while the other remained on land,
and that they should share the spoil in common. So one of them went into the water
while the other remained on land. The one which went into the water frightened the
fish, and drove them ashore, while the one which remained on land killed them; the
fish also which remained in the water were killed by the otter which had gone into
the water.
</p>
<p>Now when the heap of fish had become great, one of the otters said, “Divide the heap.”
</p>
<p>The other replied, “I will not divide it.”
</p>
<p>“Why not?”
</p>
<p>“I should not like to make a mistake.”
</p>
<p>Then the other said, “For the matter of that, I too might make a mistake.”
</p>
<p>While they stood there absorbed in thought, the jackal Mukhara came up to them and
said, “O nephews, why are you so absorbed in thought?”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, we have caught some fish.”
</p>
<p>“Why do not you divide them?”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, for fear of acting unrighteously.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Mukhara said to himself, “As they both hesitate I will undertake the division.”
</p>
<p>After looking at a tortoise which regularly waited upon the two otters, he went to
one of them and said, “O nephew, what have you done in this matter?”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, I dived into the water, and after diving into it, I frightened the fish,
which were driven on land and killed by my companion here.”
</p>
<p>“O nephew, however little was to be got by going into the water, yet Mukhara would
certainly go into the water. The otter who has to be on the dry land is exposed to
danger from fissures, tree-stumps, thorns, wild beasts, and men. Besides, if he were
not to kill the fish, of what use would your frightening them be? In short, as the
whole catch is entirely the other otter’s work, you must take what he gives you and
raise no objection.”
</p>
<p>The otter did not utter a word in reply, smitten to the heart and overawed by the
jackal.
</p>
<p>Then the jackal went to the other otter, and said, “O nephew, what was your share
in this matter?”
</p>
<p>“O uncle, I kept on the dry land, and killed the fish which were driven ashore.”
</p>
<p>“O nephew, however little was to be got by going upon dry land, yet Mukhara would
always keep to the dry land. The otter who has to go into the water is in danger from
waves and waters, from tortoises, alligators, and crocodiles. Besides, if he had not
frightened the fish, how could you have killed them? In short, all the take of the
fishing is the other otter’s work; and therefore you must be content with what your
companion gives you.” The otter, heart-smitten and overawed by the jackal’s words,
sat there without saying a word. Then Mukhara said, “O nephew, there is a means of
accomplishing the division without injustice, by means of the utterance of a śloka.”
</p>
<p>Then the two otters said despondingly, “O uncle, undertake the division.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb334">[<a href="#pb334">334</a>]</span></p>
<p>So Mukhara divided the heap into three parts, one containing the heads of the fish,
and another their tails, and the third the rest of their bodies. And he uttered this
verse:—
</p>
<p>“The goer on land receives the tails, and the goer into the depths the heads; he who
is conversant with the law receives the middle parts.”
</p>
<p>Moreover, Mukhara said to himself, “Having deluded these two, I will secure the booty.”
So he seized the middle part of a large fish, and went off to his mother. She joyfully
addressed him in a śloka<span class="corr" id="xd31e5191" title="Source: ,">.</span>
</p>
<p>“Mukhara, whence dost thou come that thou hast brought a large fish without head or
tail? whence dost thou come so highly blessed?”
</p>
<p>“Even as the king’s cat,” he replied, “that knows neither right nor wrong, in that
fools strive with one another, gains thereby, so shall we obtain food in plenty.”
</p>
<p>The mother also uttered this śloka, “O Mukhara, fine and fair exceedingly art thou
who hast been too much for the otters. They twain are content, and thou hast secured
a rich booty.”

<h2 class="main"><i>THE JACKAL SAVES THE LION.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5205src" href="#xd31e5205">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In lost past times, when the Bodisat remained in an incomplete state of merit-accumulation,
he lived in a certain hill district as a lion, king of the beasts. In the neighbourhood
of the hill there dwelt five hundred jackals, which followed after him and devoured
what he left. When the lion had killed any animal, and had eaten of its good flesh
and drunk of its good blood, he used to leave it lying on the ground and go away.
This state of things lasted a long time.
</p>
<p>Once when the lion, king of beasts, was hunting beasts at night, he fell into a well,
and all the five hundred jackals, with one exception, dispersed in divers directions.
Only one of the jackals paid any attention to the lion, sitting by the edge of the
well, and thinking in what way he could draw the lion out. While running to and fro
in the neighbourhood of the well, he saw a small lake at no great distance. Having
observed it, he dug a canal on one side, and filled the well with water from the lake,
so that the lion was able to get out. A deity uttered this verse:—
</p>
<p>“The mighty as well as the rest must make themselves friends. See how the jackal rescued
the lion from out of an old well.”

<h2 class="main"><i>THE BLUE JACKAL.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5220src" href="#xd31e5220">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In times long past there was a very greedy jackal, which used to roam in the forest,
and even in places uninhabited by men. At length he made his way into the house of
a dyer, and fell into an indigo vat. After he had escaped he lay down to sleep on
a neighbouring dunghill. Having tossed about thereon, so that his body became ever
so unshapely, he jumped into the water. When he had come out, and had been exposed
to the rays of the sun, he acquired the colour of cyanite.
</p>
<p>When the other jackals saw him, they dispersed and stood afar off, and asked, “Who
are you? where do you come from?”
</p>
<p>He replied, “My name is Śataga, and I have been appointed king of the fourfooted beasts
by Śakra, the king of the gods.”
</p>
<p>The jackals considered that, as his body was of a colour never before seen, this must
be true, and they made all the fourfooted beasts acquainted with the fact. The lions
thought, “If some one is exalted above us and made the king of the beasts, we must
go and carry this news to the chief of our band.” So they told the news to the maned
chief of their band, who dwelt in a certain hill district. He ordered the other beasts
to go forth and find out whether any animal had seen this chieftain of the fourfooted.
So they betook themselves to where the jackal was, and made <span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>inquiries. And they perceived the jackal, like unto nothing ever seen before, surrounded
by all the fourfooted creatures except the lions. Then they returned to their chief
and told him what they had seen. And he, when he had listened to them, betook himself,
surrounded by the band of lions, to where the jackal was. The jackal, surrounded by
many quadrupeds, rode along on an elephant, with the lions around him, and then the
tigers and other quadrupeds. The jackals formed a circle round him at a greater distance.
</p>
<p>Now the jackal’s mother dwelt in a certain mountain ravine. Her son sent a jackal
to her, and invited her to come, now that he had obtained the sovereign power. She
asked what was the nature of his surroundings.
</p>
<p>The messenger replied, “The inner circle is formed of lions, tigers, and elephants,
but the outer of jackals.”
</p>
<p>She said, “So much for things not following their proper order.” She also said in
verse:—
</p>
<p>“I live here comfortably in the mountain ravine, and amid cool waters enjoy my good
fortune; so long as he utters no jackal’s cry, the elephant will let him retain his
prosperity.”
</p>
<p>The messenger jackal said to the jackals, “This king of the fourfooted is only another
jackal. I have seen his mother who dwells in such and such a mountain ravine.”
</p>
<p>They replied, “In that case we will test him and see whether he is a jackal or not.”
</p>
<p>Now it is according to the nature of things that jackals, if they hear a jackal howl
without howling themselves, lose their hair.
</p>
<p>So the jackal, when he heard the other jackals lift up their voices, said to himself,
“If I utter no cry, my hair will certainly fall off. But if I get off the elephant
and then begin to howl, he will kill me. So I will lift up my voice where I am.”
</p>
<p>So soon as, sitting on the elephant, he began to lift up <span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>his voice, the elephant perceived that it was a jackal that was riding on his back,
so he flung him off and trampled him under foot. A deity uttered this verse:—
</p>
<p>“He who keeps at a distance those who should be near, and brings near those who should
be at a distance, will be cast down, as the jackal was by the elephant.”

<h2 class="main"><i>THE JACKAL HANGED BY THE OX.</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5254src" href="#xd31e5254">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long-past times, there lived in a certain hill-town a householder, who possessed
an ox marked with signs. <span class="corr" id="xd31e5258" title="Source: Śramanas">Śramaṇas</span>, Brahmans, kinsmen, the poor, the helpless, the needy, and the sick provided it with
sustenance, and it could wander about at its pleasure. One day, as it was roaming
about, it got into a certain swamp. Towards sunset came the householder, who had heard
of this, and was looking for it. As he could not get it out at the moment, he determined
to do so next morning. But the ox said, “Fling me a noose, and then go away. If a
jackal comes, I will pick up the noose with my horns and throw it over him.<span class="corr" id="xd31e5261" title="Not in source">”</span> The householder flung a noose in front of the ox and went away.
</p>
<p>In the course of the night up came a jackal, and said, “Who is it that is tearing
up these lotus roots and white lotuses?”
</p>
<p>The ox replied, “It is I. Here I am, stuck fast in the swamp.”
</p>
<p>The jackal thought it had found a feast, and prepared to do the ox an injury. The
ox said, “Get away from here; harm and disgrace might come upon you.” But as there
was no driving away the jackal, and he was still bent upon injuring as before, the
ox uttered this verse—
</p>
<p>“No lotus roots do I tear up, nor white lotuses either. If thou wishest for food mount
upon my back, there wilt thou find food.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<p>Full of gluttony, the jackal got on the back of the ox. But the ox flung the noose
with its horn, caught the jackal round the neck, and let him hang in the air. The
ox uttered this verse—
</p>
<p>“Art thou Jakara the dancing-master, or art thou one who is learning to dance? In
the forest are no fees paid; arts are taught in cities.”
</p>
<p>The jackal also uttered a verse in reply—
</p>
<p>“Not the dancing-master Jakara am I, nor one who is learning to dance. As Śakara has
provided a ladder, I betake myself to Brahma’s world.”
</p>
<p>The ox rejoined likewise in verse—
</p>
<p>“Śakara has not provided a ladder; still less is there any question about going to
Brahma’s world. As thou hast been laid in the fetters of contrivance, thou wilt never
see thyself saved.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long-past times, King Brahmadatta came to the throne in Vārāṇasī, at a period when
the land was blessed with riches, profusion, prosperity, and crops, and had a large
population. Now there were two dogs, Gaṇḍa and Upagaṇḍa by name, which used to gnaw
the king’s horse-gear. Once when King Brahmadatta was going to take the field against
the Liććhavis, he ordered his ministers to inspect the horse-gear. When they had done
this, and found that it was all torn and tattered, they said to the king, “O king,
the dogs have gnawed the horse-gear to pieces.”
</p>
<p>The king said, “Honoured sirs, if this is the case, I give up the dogs altogether.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon some of them were killed and others ran away. A dog, which came from another
country, seeing them running off, asked them what had frightened them so much. They
gave a full account of all that had occurred. It said, “Why do not you implore the
king?”
</p>
<p>They replied, “We who are running away have no power of imploring the king, and the
others have been rendered mute.”
</p>
<p>It said, “Wait awhile, I will implore the king in your behalf.”
</p>
<p>Encouraged by him they turned back; and after they had made a halt they expressed
their prayer in a verse, uttered at a distance from which they could be heard, saying—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>“These two dogs, Gaṇḍa and Upagaṇḍa, full of force and health, living in the king’s
stronghold, ought to be put to death. We are not deserving of death. O king, it is
not right to let the innocent be put to death.”
</p>
<p>Having heard this, the king said next day to his ministers, “Honoured sirs, find out
those who implored me yesterday in verse.”
</p>
<p>The ministers gave orders to the body-guards, saying, “Find out those who implored
the king yesterday in verse.”
</p>
<p>The guards said, “It was the dogs of the land that did so.”
</p>
<p>The king said, “Honoured sirs, find out whether the horse-gear was devoured by Gaṇḍa
and Upagaṇḍa, or by other dogs.”
</p>
<p>The ministers assembled, and began to take counsel together, saying, “Honoured sirs,
the king has ordered us to find out about the dogs. How shall we manage it?”
</p>
<p>Then some of them said, “There is only one way of finding out. What need is there
to seek out others? The dogs must be given a hair-pellet and made to vomit.”
</p>
<p>When the pellet of hair had been given to the dogs, and they had been made to vomit,
Gaṇḍa and Upagaṇḍa brought up fragments of leather. When the king had been informed
of this, he delivered those dogs over to death. But he rendered the others free from
fear.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long-past times there was a chieftain of a company of mice who had a retinue of
five hundred mice. And there was also a cat named Agnija. In his youth he had been
wont to kill all the mice in the neighbourhood of his dwelling-place. But afterwards,
when he had grown old, and no longer had the power of catching mice, he thought: “In
former times, when I was young, I was able to catch mice by force. But now that I
can do so no more, I must use some trick in order to make a meal off them.” So he
began to watch the mice by stealth. By means of such watching he found out that there
were five hundred mice in the troop.
</p>
<p>At a spot not far distant from the mouse-hole, he took to performing fictitious acts
of penance, and the mice, as they ran to and fro, saw him standing there with pious
mien. So they cried out to him from a distance, “Uncle, what are you doing?”
</p>
<p>The cat replied, “As in my youth I have perpetrated many vicious actions, I am now
doing penance in order to make up for them.”
</p>
<p>The mice fancied that he had given up his sinful life, and there grew up within them
confidence nourished by faith.
</p>
<p>Now as they returned into their hole every day after making their rounds, the cat
always seized on and devoured the mouse which came last. Seeing that the troop was
constantly dwindling, the chief thought: “There must be <span class="pageNum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>some cause for the fact that my mice are diminishing in number, and this cat is thriving
apace.” So he began to observe the cat closely. And when he saw that the cat was fat
and well covered with hair, he thought: “There is no doubt that this cat has killed
the mice. Therefore must I bring the matter to the light of day.”
</p>
<p>Now as he kept careful watch from a hiding-place, he saw how the cat ate up the mouse
which went last. Then from afar off he pronounced this verse—
</p>
<p>“As the uncle’s body waxes bigger, but my troop on the contrary becomes smaller, and
as he who eats roots and berries will not become fat and well covered with hair, this
is not a genuine penance, but one performed only for the sake of gain. Because the
number of the mice diminished have you, O Agnija, thrived.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long-past times, when the Bodisat was in a state of indefinite merit-aggregation,
he was the prince of a band of five hundred gazelles. Now a hunter had prepared a
great many traps, nets, and springs, for the purpose of catching gazelles. As the
gazelle prince carelessly enjoyed life, wandering about the forest with a troop of
five hundred gazelles, he was caught in a net one day while heading the troop of gazelles.
When the other gazelles saw him caught in the net, they all fled away, except one
doe which remained beside the prince. Although the gazelle prince struggled hard,
he was not able to tear the net. When the doe saw that, as she ran to and fro, she
said, “As the hunter has prepared this net, exert thyself, O blessed one, exert thyself,
O head of the gazelles.”
</p>
<p>He replied, “Although I press my hoofs firmly against the ground, yet as the net which
binds me is strong, and my feet are sorely wounded, I cannot tear the net. What then
is to be done?”
</p>
<p>Presently came the hunter towards that spot, dressed in brown clothes and bearing
a bow and arrows. The doe saw the hunter draw nigh in order to kill the gazelle prince.
Having seen him, she hurriedly exclaimed in verse—
</p>
<p>“As this is the hunter who prepared this net, exert thyself, O highly blessed gazelle
prince, exert thyself.”
</p>
<p>He replied, also in verse—
</p>
<p>“Although I set my hoofs hard against the ground, yet <span class="pageNum" id="pb347">[<a href="#pb347">347</a>]</span>as the net which binds me is strong, and my feet are sorely wounded, I am not able
to tear the net. What, then, is to be done?”
</p>
<p>Then the doe approached the hunter with courageous heart, and coming up to him uttered
this śloka—
</p>
<p>“O hunter, draw thy sword and first kill me, and then kill the gazelle prince.”
</p>
<p>When the hunter asked her with astonishment what she had to do with the gazelle prince,
she replied, “He is my husband.” The hunter replied in a verse—
</p>
<p>“I will kill neither thee nor the gazelle prince. Thou shalt keep company with thy
beloved spouse.”
</p>
<p>She answered, likewise in a verse—
</p>
<p>“As I, O hunter, take pleasure in my dear spouse, so mayst thou, O hunter, enjoy thyself
with all that belongs to thee.”
</p>
<p>The hunter, whose astonishment became still greater, went away together with the gazelles,
whom he left at liberty.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long-past times there lived in a hill-place a troop of five hundred monkeys, which,
when the corn was ripe, devoured the crops. The men who lived in that place assembled
and began to take counsel together, saying—
</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, what shall we do, seeing that the monkeys endanger the corn?”
</p>
<p>Some of them held that the monkeys must be killed. But how were they to set about
doing that? All the trees which stood around the place must be cut down, one Tinduka<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5385src" href="#xd31e5385">2</a> tree only being allowed to stand. And a hedge of thorns must be drawn around, and
the monkeys must be killed inside the enclosure, when they climbed the tree in search
of food. Accordingly all the trees growing around that place were cut down, only one
Tinduka tree being allowed to stand; and that tree was surrounded by a hedge of thorns,
and a watchman was set there, with orders to give notice as soon as the monkeys assembled.
</p>
<p>Now one day when the Tinduka tree had put forth flowers and fruits, and these had
grown ripe, the monkeys said to their chief—
</p>
<p>“O chief, as the Tinduka tree is ripe, let us go to it and eat.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the chief, with a troop of five hundred monkeys, climbed the Tinduka tree,
and they began to devour the fruit. The watchman brought word to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>men who dwelt in that place, saying, “Honoured sirs, all the monkeys have climbed
up the Tinduka tree and are feeding. Do ye do what ought to be done.”
</p>
<p>Then in all haste the troop of men who dwelt there, with clenched fists, and armed
with bows and arrows and battle-axes, betook themselves to the Tinduka tree and began
to cut it down. Fear came upon the monkeys, and they sprang to and fro on the tree.
But the chief sat still and did nothing. The monkeys said to him, “O chief, wherefore
do you sit there tranquilly, while we are running to and fro in the pangs of intolerable
misery?” He replied in a verse—
</p>
<p>“The busy and the idle are like unto each other. The ends of the tree are many; let
food be taken by him who is intent upon his life.”
</p>
<p>At that time one of the monkey-chief’s young ones, a captive in the village, was sitting
absorbed in thought, leaning his cheek upon his hand. A good monkey came that way,
saw the young monkey thus absorbed in thought, and said—
</p>
<p>“O friend, why do you sit there thus absorbed in thought, leaning your cheek upon
your hand?”
</p>
<p>The young monkey replied—
</p>
<p>“How could I not be absorbed in thought, since the whole troop of the men who live
in the village have taken the field in order to put my relatives to death?”
</p>
<p>“Why do you not behave with courage?”
</p>
<p>“How can a captive behave with courage?”
</p>
<p>“I will set you free from your bonds.”
</p>
<p>So soon as the young monkey was set free, he set the village on fire. When it began
to burn, and clamour and uproar arose, the inhabitants heard it and said—
</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, while we and the monkeys are at a distance, a great calamity has occurred.
As the village is burning, we will put out the fire and then come back.”
</p>
<p>So they hastened to put out the fire; but the monkeys came down from the Tinduka tree
and ran away.

<p class="first">In long-past times, in a spot well provided with flowers and fruits, in the neighbourhood
of a hill-town, there lived two chiefs of monkey troops, each of which was composed
of five hundred monkeys. One of the two chiefs dreamed one night that he was placed
alive in a caldron, together with a retinue of five hundred monkeys. At this he was
greatly alarmed, and he gave way to lamentation. Before the break of day he arose
and called the monkeys together, and began to relate to them his dreams.
</p>
<p>“Honoured sirs, last night I dreamed an evil dream, in consequence whereof we will
leave this place.”
</p>
<p>The monkeys said, “Let us do so and set forth.”
</p>
<p>As Bodisats have dreams which are full of significance, the august being said to the
chief of the other band of monkeys, “As I have dreamed such a dream, it is to be hoped
that you will move somewhere else.”
</p>
<p>The other chief answered incredulously, “Do dreams then turn out true? If you want
to go, in that case go. But as I possess a widely extended domain, I shall not go.”
</p>
<p>When the first monkey-chief saw that the other did not believe in him, he himself,
together with his band, went away.
</p>
<p>One day after this, as a servant-maid was roasting barley on the earth in one of the
houses of the hill-town, a <span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>wandering sheep came by bad luck that way, and began to eat the grain. The maid struck
the sheep with a fire-brand, and the sheep ran blazing into the king’s elephant stable.
From its flames the elephant stable caught fire, and many elephants were scorched.
The king sent for the doctor, and asked how the elephants which had been scorched
by the fire ought to be treated. The doctor prescribed monkeys cooked in barley-meal.
Accordingly orders were given to the hunters, who caught all the monkeys residing
in the neighbourhood. These monkeys, whose flesh had increased in the course of time,
the doctor threw into the caldron alive.
</p>
<p>A deity uttered this verse: “It is not good to dwell in a town or a village in which
discord exists. On account of discord between the sheep and the servant-maid, the
monkeys perished.”

<p class="first">In long-past times there lived in a certain country two monkey chiefs, each ruling
over a band of five hundred monkeys. As one of them wandered about with his band he
gradually came to a hill-village. A kimpāka tree grew there, the branches of which
were bowed down to the ground by the fruit, so the monkeys said to the chief of their
band: “O chief, as the tree is very rich in fruit, and the fruit weighs its branches
down to the ground, let us after our fatigues enjoy the fruit.”
</p>
<p>After looking at the tree, the chief of the band said in a verse: “Although the tree
stands near the village, yet have the children not partaken of the fruit. From that
it may be concluded that the fruit of this tree is not conducive to enjoyment.”
</p>
<p>After he had thus spoken, they went away.
</p>
<p>Following after him, the leader of the other band also gradually drew near to that
village. And when the monkeys saw the kimpāka tree, they said to the leader of their
band: “O leader, as there is fruit on this tree, and we are fatigued, we would like
to enjoy the fruit and gain strength.”
</p>
<p>He replied, “Good; do so.”
</p>
<p>The monkeys partook of the fruit, and unfortunately suffered agonies in consequence.

<p class="first">In long-past times there lived a band of monkeys in a forest. As they rambled about
they saw the reflection of the moon in a well, and the leader of the band said: “O
friends, the moon has fallen into the well. The world is now without a moon. Ought
not we to draw it out?”
</p>
<p>The monkeys said, “Good; we will draw it out.”
</p>
<p>So they began to hold counsel as to how they were to draw it out. Some of them said,
“Do not you know? The monkeys must form a chain, and so draw the moon out.”
</p>
<p>So they formed a chain, the first monkey hanging on to the branch of a tree, and the
second to the first monkey’s tail, and a third one in its turn to the tail of the
second one. When in this way they were all hanging on to one another, the branch began
to bend a good deal. The water became troubled, the reflection of the moon disappeared,
the branch broke, and all the monkeys fell into the well and were disagreeably damaged.
</p>
<p>A deity uttered this verse: “When the foolish have a foolish leader, they all go to
ruin, like the monkeys which wanted to draw the moon up from the well.”

<p>When she had looked at the peacock, she said, “He shall be my husband.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In long-past times the men of Rājagṛiha and their king determined, on account of some
occurrence or other, to establish two cemeteries, and to bury men in one of them and
women in the other. It happened once that a hermaphrodite died and could find room
neither in the one cemetery nor in the other. In a certain locality in Rājagṛiha there
was a park full of roots, fruits, splendid flowers, and various singing-birds. There
a Rishi dwelt with shaven head, who fed upon roots, fruits, and water, and was clothed
in a hide and the bark of trees. A ricinus shrub grew there in a three-cornered field,
and there the body of the hermaphrodite was left. Perceiving the smell of the body,
a jackal came and began to devour its flesh. Now a crow had built her nest on the
top of the ricinus tree, and was nestling in it. It occurred to her to flatter the
jackal, in order that he might give her the remains of the feast, so she began to
sing his praises in a verse: “As I testify my reverence for thee, who art provided
with the neck of a lion and the back of a bull, so deign to be gracious to me for
the benefit of the asker.”
</p>
<p>The jackal looked up and said, likewise in verse: “O most excellent of birds, wanderer
through the air, lighter-up of all places, now like unto a gem dwelling upon the summit
of a splendid tree.”
</p>
<p>The crow continued, “As I have descended in order to <span class="pageNum" id="pb357">[<a href="#pb357">357</a>]</span>look upon one so highly blest, and as I pay honour to thee as the king of the beasts,
deign to be gracious in behalf of the asker.”
</p>
<p>The jackal said, “O crow, whose neck is like unto the neck of the peacock; O most
excellent of pleasure-bringers, fair to see, descend in order to feed at will.”
</p>
<p>The crow flew down, and, in the company of the jackal, began to devour the dead body.
</p>
<p>When the Rishi saw that, he said in a verse: “Alas! from afar off have I seen thee,
shamelessly nestling in the shadow of the most wretched of trees, and devouring the
most wretched of corpses.”
</p>
<p>When the crow heard that, she indignantly uttered this verse: “What is it to this
baldpate that the lion and the peacock, feeding here upon excellent flesh, prolong
their existence by means of strangers’ gifts?”
</p>
<p>The Rishi was affronted in his turn and uttered this verse: “See here the union of
the shameless. The most wretched of birds is the crow, the most wretched of beasts
is the jackal, the most wretched of trees is the ricinus tree, the most wretched of
men is the hermaphrodite, the most wretched of fields is the three-cornered one.”
</p>
<p>Then an exceedingly great anger sprang up within the mind of the crow, and she betook
herself to the Rishi’s kitchen, and began to look about her. Seeing nothing there,
she broke the pots and pitchers, and then flew away. When the Rishi came into his
kitchen, and found the pots and pitchers broken, he knew that it was none but the
bad crow who had done that, and he said in a verse: “To her who, without being told,
has with shameless malice broken the things in the kitchen, shall in future, whether
for praise or for blame, not even the smallest word be spoken. The wise ever obtain
repose only by means of this, that they keep silence.”

<p class="first">In long-past time there lived on the sea-coast two pheasants, named Dharmika and Adharmika,
whose bodies were united in their growth. Once while Adharmika was asleep, Dharmika
kept awake, and saw an amṛita fruit driven ashore by the waters. He took it out and
considered whether he should wake the other or eat the fruit by himself. Reflecting
that if he ate it, the body they shared in common would be nourished thereby, he did
not wake the other.
</p>
<p>When the other awoke of his own accord, and perceived that Dharmika’s breath smelt
of amṛita fruit, he said, “What is it your breath smells of?”
</p>
<p>“Amṛita fruit,” replied Dharmika.
</p>
<p>“Where did you get it?” asked Adharmika.
</p>
<p>Dharmika replied, “I found an amṛita fruit while you were asleep, and I ate it without
waking you, because I considered that our common body would be nourished thereby.”
</p>
<p>Adharmika said, “As you have not acted rightly therein, I also will bide my time.”
</p>
<p>On another occasion, when Dharmika had gone to sleep and Adharmika was awake, the
latter perceived a poisonous fruit which the waves had brought ashore. He ate it,
and both of the birds became insensible. Affected by the poisonous fruit, Adharmika
said, “Wherever I may be <span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359">359</a>]</span>born again, there may I be thy antagonist, O enemy and slayer!”

beak devours an ambrosia-like fruit, which it refuses to share with its companion.
The aggrieved beak, out of spite, eats a poisonous fruit and the bird dies. With this
may be compared the following passage, quoted from the Muṇḍaka Upanishad by Prof.
Monier Williams (Indian Wisdom, p. 42), “Two birds (the Paramātiman and Jīvātman,
or supreme and individual souls), always united, of the same name, occupy the same
tree (abide in the same body). One of them (the Jīvātman) enjoys the sweet fruit of
the fig (or fruit of acts), the other looks on as a witness. Dwelling on the same
tree (with the supreme soul), the deluded (individual) soul, immersed (in worldly
relations), is grieved by the want of power; but when it perceives the Ruler, separate
(from worldly relations) and his glory, then its grief ceases. When the beholder sees
the golden-coloured maker (of the world), the lord, the soul, the source of Brahmā,
then, having become wise, shaking off virtue and vice, without taint of any kind,
he obtains the highest identity.”&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e5547src" title="Return to note 2 in text.">↑</a></p>

“Wife of my friend, cook this rice and serve it up to me.”

<p>The woman began to cook the rice, but her store of wood came to an end, and yet the
rice remained uncooked. When the painter came home, he asked, “Good wife, what is

<p>She told him the whole story. The man looked at the rice, perceived that the separate

wait upon the wearied traveller, the mechanician sent an artificial maiden whom he
had framed.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5589src" href="#xd31e5589">4</a> She washed his feet, and then stood still. He called to her to draw near. But she
made no reply. As he was of the opinion that the mechanic had no doubt sent her to
him for his enjoyment, he seized her by the hand and tried to draw her towards him.
Thereupon, however, the artificial maiden collapsed, and turned into a heap of chips.
Being thus befooled, he said to himself, “I have been made a fool of here in private.
But in return I will make a fool of the mechanician in the midst of the king’s retinue.”

the mechanician came to see why the painter had not made his appearance, and imagined
he saw him hanging there. While he was considering what could be the painter’s reason
for depriving himself of life, he saw <span class="pageNum" id="pb362">[<a href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>that the artificial maiden had collapsed and turned into a heap of chips. Thereupon
he fancied that the painter had hanged himself out of vexation at having been made
a fool of.
</p>
<p>Now it was the custom in the Yavana land, that whenever any one died suddenly in any
house, the funeral could not take place until information thereof had been given to
the king. So the mechanician went to the king and told him that a painter from Madhyadeśa
had put up at his house, and that he had sent an artificial maiden to wait upon him,
and that the painter had seized her by the hand and tried to draw her towards him,
whereupon she had turned into a heap of chips; and that the painter, out of vexation
at being made a fool of, had hanged himself. And he besought the king to have the
corpse inspected, in order that he might be able to bury it.
</p>
<p>The king ordered his officials to undertake the inspection. When the officials reached
the spot, and began to consider how they should get the hanged man down, some of them
recommended that the rope should be cut, and accordingly an axe was fetched. But when
they were about to cut the rope, they perceived that what was before them was only
a door, and that the mechanician had been made a fool of. Then the painter came forth
from his hiding-place and said, “O inmate of this house, you made a fool of me in
private. But I have made a fool of you in the midst of the royal retinue.”

<h3 class="main">3. THE COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TWO ARTISTS.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e5607src" href="#xd31e5607">5</a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In olden times a dispute arose between two painters in a hill-place, each of the two
affirming that he was superior in art to the other. They went before the king, and
fell at his feet. Then each of them explained how he was a better artist than the
other. As the king could not settle their dispute, he pointed to the entrance hall,
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span>ordered each of them to paint one of its walls. When their work was finished, he would
be in a position to decide which of them was the better artist.
</p>
<p>They set to work, divided from one another by a curtain. One of them painted a picture,
and completed it in six months. But the other in six months covered the surface of
his wall with mosaic work. Having finished his picture, the first artist came before
the king and said, “O king, my picture is finished, may it please you to set eyes
upon it.”
</p>
<p>When the king, attended by his ministers, had passed through the doorway and gazed
upon the picture, he was well pleased and said, “The painting is excellent.” Then
the other artist fell at his feet and said, “Now vouchsafe to look at my picture.”
When he had drawn the curtain aside, and the king saw several figures standing well
out, he marvelled greatly and said, “Of the two paintings this is the most excellent.”
Then the artist drew the curtain once more in front of his work, and fell at the king’s
feet and said, “O king, this is no painting. I have decorated the wall in mosaic.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the king’s astonishment waxed still greater, and he said, “This is the one
who is the best artist.”

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e5559src">1</a></span> In S. Beal’s “Romantic Legend of <span class="corr" id="xd31e5561" title="Source: Sākya">Śākya</span> Buddha,” pp. 93–96, it is related how the son of a man of quality in Vārāṇasī, in
order to obtain the hand of a blacksmith’s daughter, applied himself to making fine
needles, and made such progress in the art that he included, among the needles which
he showed to the smith, one which could float on the surface of water. This tale occurs
in a somewhat different shape in the Mākandikāvadāna in the Divyāvadāna, p. 239 of
the St. Petersburg MS. A Brahman’s son in a hill-place, entering the house of a smith
in order to collect alms, falls in love with the smith’s daughter, but learns that
her father will give her to that man only who can equal or surpass him in art. The
Brahman youth applied himself to the art of making needles, and then came to the smith’s
house, and offered him needles for sale. All the seven needles which he produced as
a test of his skill are of such a nature that they float upon water, even the largest
among them not being excepted.—S.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e5559src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear

on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
